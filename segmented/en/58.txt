accepting the ted prize larry brilliant talk about how smallpox was eradicated from the planet and call for new global system that can identify and contain pandemic before they spread google ted prize collaboration disease epidemiology global issues health science technology larry brilliant want stop pandemic the luck iest guy the world got see the last case killer smallpox the world was india this past year and may have seen the last case polio the world there s nothing that makes you feel more the bless and the honor working program like that than know that something that horrible longer exists going tell going show you some dirty pictures they are difficult watch but you should look them with optimism because the horror these pictures will match the lifting quality know that they longer exist but first going tell you little bit about own journey background not exactly the conventional medical education that you might expect when was inter francisco heard about group native americans who had taken over alcatraz island and native american who wanted give birth that island and other doctor wanted and help her give birth went out alcatraz and lived the island for several weeks she gave birth caught the baby got off the island landed francisco and all the press wanted talk because three weeks the island made expert indian affairs wound every television show someone saw television they called and they asked like movie and play young doctor for bunch rock and roll stars who were travel bus ride from francisco england and said yes would that became the doctor absolutely awful movie called medicine ball caravan now you know from the s you either the bus you off the bus was the bus wife and years join the bus our bus ride took from francisco london switch buses the big pond then got two more buses and drove through turkey and iran afghanistan over the khyber pass into pakistan like every other young doctor this the khyber pass and that s our bus had some difficult getting over the khyber pass but wound india and then like everyone else our generation went live alayan monastery this just like residency program for those you that are medical school and studied with wise man guru named karoli baba who then told get rid the dress put three piece suit join the united nations diplomat and work for the world health organization and made outrageous prediction that smallpox would eradicated and that this was god s gift humanity because the hard work dedicated scientists and that prediction came true and this little girl rahima and she was the last case killer smallpox the world and this document the certificate that the global commission signed cert the world have eradicated the first disease history the key eradicating smallpox was early detection early response going ask you repeat that early detection early response can you say that audience early detection early response larry brilliant smallpox was the worst disease history killed more people than all the war history the last century killed million people more than two you reading about larry page already somebody read very fast the year that larry page and sergey with whom have certain affect and new affiliation the year which they were born two million people died smallpox declar smallpox eradicated this the most important slide that ever seen public health because shows you the richest and the strong and king and queen the world did not protect you from dying smallpox never can you doubt that are all this together but see smallpox from the perspective sovereign the wrong perspective you should see from the perspective mother watching her child develop this disease and standing help less day one day two day three day four day five day six you mother and you watching your child and day six you see pustules that become hard day seven they show the classic cars smallpox umbilic ation day eight and gore said earlier that the most photograph image the world the most printed image the world was that the earth but this was and that moment this photograph was the photograph that was the most widely printed because printed two billion copies this photograph and took them hand hand door door show people and ask them there was smallpox their house because that was our surveillance system didn have google didn have web crawler didn have computers day nine you look this picture and you horr ified look this picture and say thank god because s clear that this only ordinary case smallpox and know this child will live and day the lesions are scabb his eyelids are swollen but you know this child has other second infection and day while will for life will live there are other kinds smallpox that are not like that this confluent smallpox which there isn single place the body where you could put finger and not covered lesions flat smallpox which killed percent people who got and hemorrhagic smallpox the most cruel all which had predilecti for pregnant women probably had women die they all had hemorrhagic smallpox never seen anybody die from who wasn pregnant woman the who embarked what was outrageous program eradicate disease that year there were countries affected with smallpox were down countries were down five countries but that year smallpox explod throughout india and india was the place where smallpox made last stand india had population million there are linguistic states india which like saying different countries there are million people the road any time buses and train walking village million household and none them wanted report they had case smallpox their house because they thought that smallpox was the visit ation deity shit the cool mother and was wrong bring strangers into your house when the deity was the house incentive report smallpox wasn just india that had smallpox ities smallpox ities were prevalent all over the world how eradicated smallpox was max vacci nation wouldn work you could vaccinate everybody india but one year later there million new babies which was then the population canada wouldn just vaccinate everyone you had find every single case smallpox the world the same time and draw circle immun around and that s what did india alone best friends and went door door with that same picture every single house india made over one billion house call and the process learned something very important every time did house house search had spike the number report smallpox when didn search had the illusion that there was disease when did search had the illusion that there was more disease surveillance system was necessary because what needed was early detection early response search and search and found every case smallpox india had reward raised the reward continued increase the reward had score card that wrote every house and did that the number reported case the world dropped zero and declar the lobe free smallpox was the largest campaign united nations history until the iraq war people from all over the world doctors every race religion culture and nation who fought side side brother and sister with each other not against each other common cause make the world better but smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication failed three other times failed against malaria yellow ever and yaws but soon may see polio eradicated but the key eradicating polio early detection early response this may the year eradicate polio that will make the second disease history and david who s watching this the cast david keep going close down four countries feel like bonds can replace any time let s get another disease off the list terrible things worry about was just india working the polio program the polio surveillance program four million people going door door that the surveillance system but need have early detection early response blindness the same thing the key discovering blindness doing epidemio logical survey and finding out the causes blindness you can mount the correct response the seva foundation was started group alumni the smallpox eradication program who having climbed the highest mountain taste the elixir the success eradicating disease wanted again and over the last years seva s program countries have given back sight more than two million blind people seva got started because wanted apply these lesson surveillance and epidemiology something which nobody else was looking public health issue blindness which here fore had been thought only clinical disease steve jobs gave that computer which apple number and s still kathmandu and s still working and ought get and auction off and make more money for seva and conduc the first nepal survey ever done for health and the first nation wide blindness survey ever done and had astonishing results instead finding out what thought was the case that blindness was caused mostly glaucoma and trachoma were astound find out that blindness was caused instead cataract you can cure prevent what you don know there your ted pack ages there s dvd infinite vision about and the aravind eye hospital hope that you will take look aravind which started seva project now the world s largest and best eye hospital this year that one hospital will give back sight more than people tamil nadu india bird flu stand here represent ative all terrible things this might the worst the key prevent mitigat pandemic bird flu early detection and rapid response will not have vaccine adequate supplies anti viral combat bird flu occur the next three years who stages the progress pandemic are now stage three the pandemic alert stage with just little bit human human transmission but human human human sustain transmission the moment who says moved category four this will not like katrina the world know will stop there airplanes flying would you get airplane with people you didn know cough and sneez when you knew that some them might carry disease that could kill you for which you had anti viral vaccine did study the top epidemiologist the world october asked them these are all ologists and special influenza and asked them the questions you like ask them what you think the likelihood that there pandemic happens how bad you think will percent said they thought there pandemic within three years but much worse than that percent said they thought there pandemic within your children your grandchildren s life time and they thought that there was pandemic billion people would get sick many million people would die there would global recessi and depression our just time inventor system and the tight rubber band global ization broke and the cost our economy one three trillion dollars would far worse for everyone than merely million people dying because many more people would lose their job and their healthcare benefits that the consequence are almost unthinkable and s getting worse because travel getting much better let show you simulation what pandemic looks like know what talking about let s assume for example that the first case occur south asia initial goes quite slowly you get two three discrete location then there second outbreak and the disease will spread from country country fast that you won know what hit you within three weeks will everywhere the world now had button and could back and late and grab when first started could find early and had early detection and early response and could put each one those viruses jail that s the only way deal with something like pandemic and let show you why that have joke this epidemic curve and everyone medicine think ultimately gets know what but the joke epidemiologist like arrive epidemic right here and ride glory the down hill curve but you don get that usually you usually arrive right about here what really want arrive right here can stop the epidemic but you can always that but there s organization that has been able find way learn when the first case occur and that called gphin s the global public health information network and that simulation that showed you that you thought was bird flu that was sars and sars the pandemic that did not occur and didn occur because gphin found the pandemic sars three months before who actually announced and because that were able stop the sars pandemic and think owe great debt gratitude gphin and ron john who hope the audience some place over there who s the found gphin hello ron and ted has flown ron here from ottawa where gphin located because not only did gphin find sars early but you may have seen last week that iran announced that they had bird flu iran but gphin found the bird flu iran not february but last september need early warning system protect against the things that are humanity s worst nightmare and ted wish based the common denomi these experience smallpox early detection early response blindness polio early detection early response pandemic bird flu early detection early response obvious that our only way dealing with these new diseases find them early and kill them before they spread ted wish for you help build global system early warning system protect against humanity s worst nightmare and what thought would call early detection but should really called total early detection but all serious ness because this idea birth ted would like legacy ted and like call the international system for total early disease detection and stedd then becomes our mantra instead hidden pandemic bird flu find and immediately contain instead novel virus caused bio terror bio error shift drift find and contain instead industrial accident like oil pills the catastrophe bhopal find them and respond them instead famine hidden until too late detect and respond and instead system which owned government and hidden the bowels government let s build early detection system that s freely available anyone the world their own language let s make transparent non government not owned any single country company house neutral country with redundant back different time zone and different continent and let s build gphin let s start with gphin let s increase the website that they crawl from million let s increase the languages they crawl from seven more let s build bound confirm ation message using text message sms instant mess aging find out from people who are within meters the rumor that you hear fact valid and let s add satellite confirm ation and add gapminder s amazing graphic the front end and grow moral force the world finding out those terrible things before anybody else know about them and sending our response them that next year instead meeting here ment how many terrible things there are the world will have pulled together used the unique skills and the magic this community and proud that have done everything can stop pandemic other catastrophe and change the world beginning right now chris anderson amazing presentation first all just everyone understand you saying that building creating web crawler looking the internet for patterns they can detect something suspicious before who before anyone else can see just explain give example how that could possibly true larry brilliant first all you not mad about the copy right viol ation love well you know ron john hope you and meet him the dinner afterwards and talk him when started gphin there was outbreak bird flu was hong kong and remarkable doctor hong kong responded immediately slaughte ring million chicken and birds and they stopped that outbreak track immediate detection immediate response then number years went and there were lot rumor about bird flu ron and his team ottawa began crawl the web only crawl different website mostly periodic and they read about and heard about concern lot children who had high ever and symptoms bird flu they reported this who who took little while taking action because who will only receive report from government because s the united nations but they were able point who and let them know that there was this surprising and explained cluster illness that looked like bird flu that turned out sars that s how the world found out about sars and because that were able stop sars now what s really important that before there was gphin percent all the world s report bad things whether you talking about famine you talking about bird flu you talking about ebola percent all those report came from nations the moment these guys ottawa budget dollars year got crack percent all the report the world came from gphin percent all the report the world came from all the other nations now here s what s real interesting after they been working for couple years what you think happened those nations they felt pretty stupid they started sending their report earlier now their report percentage down percent because other nations have started report can you find diseases early crawl the web course you can can you find even earlier than gphin does now course you can you saw that they found sars using their chinese web crawler full six weeks before they found using their english web crawler well they only crawl seven languages these bad viruses really don have any intention showing first english spanish french yes want take gphin want build want add all the languages the world that possibly can want make this open everybody that the health office nairobi will have much access the folks ottawa cdc and want make part our culture that there community people who are watching out for the worst nightmare humanity and that s accessible everyone
