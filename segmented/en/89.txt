arctic explorer ben saunders count his rowing solo ski trek the north pole complete with engaging anecdotes gorgeous photos and never before seen video climate change culture exploration global issues personal growth potential sports technology ben saunders ski the north pole this name ben saunders special dragging heavy things around cold places may last year stood alone the north geographic pole was the only human being area one and half times the size america five and half thousand square miles more than people have climbed ever people have stood the moon including only four people have skied solo the north pole and think the reason for that thank you think the reason for that that s s well s chris said bonkers s journey that right the limit human capability skied the equivalent marathons back back miles weeks and was dragging all the food needed the supplies the equipment sleeping bag one change under wear everything needed for nearly three months what going try and today the and bit minutes got left try and answer three questions the first one why the second one how you the loo minus ben read somewhere that minus expose skin becomes frostbitten less than minute how you answer the call nature don want answer these now come them the end third one how you top that what s next all started back first expedition was with guy called pen enormous experience chap this was like polar apprenticeship were trying ski from this group island here naya zemlya the north pole and the thing that fascinates about the north pole geographic north pole that s bang the middle the sea this about good map get and reach you got ski literally over the frozen crust the floating skin ice the artic ocean spoken all the experts read lots books studied map and chart but realized the morning day one that had idea exactly what let myself for was years old one age had attempt anything like this and pretty quickly almost everything that could have gone wrong did wrong were attack polar bear day two had frostbite left big started running very low food were both pretty hungry losing lots weight some very unusual weather conditions very difficult ice conditions had decided low tech communication couldn afford satellite phone had radio you can see two ski pole stick out the roof the tent there s wire down either side that was our radio antenna had less than two hours two way communication with the outside world two months ultimately ran out time skied miles were just over miles left the pole and run out time were too late into the summer the ice was starting melt spoke the russian helicopter pilots the radio and they said look boys you run out time got pick you and felt that had failed whole heart was failure the one goal the one dream had for long could remember hadn even come close and skiing along that first trip had two imaginary video clip that play over and over again mind when the going got tough just keep motivation going the first one was reaching the pole itself could see vivid suppose being film out the door helicopter there was kind rock music playing the background and had ski pole with union jack you know flying the wind could see myself stick the flag pole you know glorious moment the music kind reaching crescendo the second video clip that imagine was getting back heathrow airport and could see again vivid the camera flash bulb going off the paparazzi the auto graph hunters the book agent coming sign for deal and course neither these things happened didn get the pole and didn have any money pay anyone the one had heard this expedition and got back heathrow mum was there brother was there grand was there had little union jack and that was about went back live with mum was physically exhaust mental absolute wreck considered myself failure huge amount debt personally this expedition and ly mum s sofa day day out watching time brother sent text message sms was quote from the simpsons said you tried your hardest and failed miserably the lesson don even try fast forward three years did eventually get off the sofa and start planning another expedition this time wanted right across own this time from russia the top the map the north pole where the sort the middle and then canada one has made complete crossing the arctic ocean their own two norwegian did team one s done solo very famous very accomplish italian mountain hold mess tried and was rescue after week described this expedition times dangerous ever for some reason this was what wanted have crack but knew that even stand chance getting home one piece let alone make across canada had take radical approach this meant everything from perfect the off sub two gram toothbrush working with one the world s leading nutrition developing completely new evolutionary nutrition strategy from scratch calorie day and the expedition started february last year big support team had film crew couple logistics people with girl friend photographer first was pretty sensible flew british ways moscow the next bit siberia krasnoyarsk russian internal airline called krasair spell s the next bit chart pretty elder russian plane fly town called khatanga which was the sort last bit civilization our camera who turned out was pretty nervous the best times actually asked the pilot before got the plane how long this flight would take and the pilot russian pilot completely dead replied six hours live got khatanga think the joke that khatanga isn the end the world but you can see from there was supposed over night stay were stuck there for days there was kind vodka fuel pay between the helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter were stuck couldn move finally morning day got the all clear loaded the helicopter two helicopter flying tandem dropped off the edge the pack ice had frantic sort minutes film photography while the helicopter was still there did interview the satellite phone and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter the door closed and was alone and don know words will ever quite that moment justice all could think about was running back the door bang the door and saying look guys haven quite thought this through make things worse you can just see the white the top right hand side the screen that s full moon because been held russia course the full moon bring the highest and lowest tides when you standing the frozen surface the sea high and low tides generally mean that interesting things are going happen the ice going start moving around bit was you can see there pull two sledge grand total all days food and fuel kilo that s almost exactly pounds when the ice was flat flat could just about pull both when the ice wasn flat didn have hope hell had pull one leave and back and get the other one literally bling through what s called pressure ice the ice had been smashed under the pressure the current the ocean the wind and the tides nasa described the ice conditions last year the worst since records began and s always drift the pack ice always drift was skiing into head wind for nine out the weeks was alone last year and was drift backwards most the time record was minus miles got the morning took the tent down skied north for seven and half hours put the tent and was two and half miles further back than when started literally couldn keep with the drift the ice s day ly the tent getting ready the weather just appalling drift back about five miles the last last night later the expedition the problem was longer the ice was lack ice open water knew this was happening knew the artic was warming knew there was more open water and had secret weapon sleeve this was little bit bio mimicry polar bear the artic ocean move dead straight lines they come water they climb swim across had dry suit developed worked with team based sort survival suit suppose that helicopter pilots would wear that could climb into would over boots over tens would pull around face and seal pretty tight around face and this meant could ski over very thin ice and fell through wasn the end the world also meant the worst came the worst could actually jump and swim across and drag the sledge over after some pretty radical technology radical approach but worked perfectly another exciting thing did last year was with communication technology s urance expedition there was one his crew guy called thomas lees said the explorer there anything left explore will doubt carry pocket wireless telephone fitted with wireless telescope well lees guess wrong about eight years this pocket wireless telephone iridium satellite phone the wireless telescope was digital camera had tucked pocket and every single day the days was alone the ice was blogging live from tent sending back little diary piece sending back information the distance covered the ice conditions the temperature and daily photo remember had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world last year blogging live from expedition that s been described times dangerous ever wasn all high tech this navigat what s called white when you get lots low cloud the wind starts blow the you can see awful lot you can just see there s yellow ribb tied one ski pole navigate using the direction the wind kind weird combination high tech and low tech got the pole the may took days get there from russia and there nothing there there isn even pole the pole there s nothing there purely because s sea ice s drift stick flag there leave there pretty soon will drift off usually towards canada green land knew this but was expecting something strange mixture feeling was extremely warm this stage lot open water around and course ated that got there under own team but starting really realize that chance making all the way across canada which was still miles away were slim best the only got that was there blurry photo gps the little satellite navigat gadget you can just see there s nine and string zero here nine degrees north that bang the north pole took photo that down sledge did sort video diary piece took few photos got satellite phone out warm the battery dialed three number dialed mum dialed girl friend dialed the ceo sponsor and got three voice mail nine s special feeling the entire planet rotating beneath feet the the whole world underneath finally got through mum she was the queue the supermarket she started cry she asked call her back skied for week past the pole wanted get close canada could before conditions just got too dangerous continue this was the last day had the ice when spoke the project management team they said look ben conditions are getting too dangerous there are huge areas open water just south your position like pick you ben could you please look for airstrip this was the view outside tent when had this phone call never tried build airstrip before tony the expedition manager said look ben you got find meters flat thick safe ice the only bit ice could find took hours skiing around trying find airstrip was exactly meters could measure with ski didn tell tony that didn tell the pilots that thought have just about worked pretty dramatic land the plane actually passed over four times and was bit worried wasn going land all the pilot knew was called troy was expecting someone called troy that did this for living pretty tough kind guy was bawling eyes out the time the plane landed pretty emotional moment thought got compose myself for troy supposed the rough tough explorer type the plane taxi where was standing the door opened this guy jump out s about that said name troy the pilot was lady called monica she there sort hand knit jump they were the least people ever met but they made day troy was smoking cigarette the ice took few photos climbed the said just just get the back threw his cigarette out got the front and climbed the back taxi and down the few times just flatten out bit and said right going going give and now learned that this standard practice but had worried the time put his hand the throttle you can see the control for the engine actually the roof the cockpit s that little bar there put his hand the throttle monica very put her hand sort top his thought god here this all nothing rammed forward bounced down the just took off one the ski just clip pressure ridge the end the bank could see into the cockpit troy battl the control and just took one hand off reached back flip switch the roof the cockpit and was the fast seat belt sign you can see the wall and only from the air did see the big picture course when you the ice you only ever see one obstacle time whether s pressure ridge there s bit water this probably why didn get into trouble about the length airstrip mean really was starting break why not explorer the traditional sense not skiing along drawing map everyone know where the north pole the south pole there s big scientific base there s airstrip there s cafe and there s tourist shop for this about exploring human limits about exploring the limits physiology psychology and technology they the things that excite and s also about potential personal level this for chance explore the limits really push the limits own potential see how far they stretch and wider scale amazes how people through life just scratch the surface their potential just doing three four five percent what they truly capable wider scale hope that this journey was chance inspire other people think about what they want with their potential and what they want with the tiny amount time each have this planet that s close can come that the next question how you answer the call nature minus the answer course which trade secret and the last question what s next quickly possible have minute left the end into more detail what s next antarctic s the cold highest wind iest and dries continent earth late early there was race the first the south pole the heart the antarctic continent you include the coast ice shelves you can see that the ross ice s the big one down here the ross ice the size france antarctic you include the ice shelves twice the size australia s big place and there s race get the pole between amundsen the norwegian amundsen had dog sleds and skies and scott the british guy captain scott scott had sort ponies and some actor and few dogs all which went wrong and scott and his team four people ended foot they got the pole late january find norwegian flag already there there was tent letter the norwegian king and they turned around head back the coast and all five them died the return journey since then one has ever skied this was years ago since then one has ever skied from the coast antarctic the pole and back every south pole expedition you may have heard about either flown out from the pole has used vehicles dogs kite some kind crossing one has ever made return journey that s the plan two are doing that s pretty much one final thought before get the toilet bit have and meant this and forgotten but have have school report was years old and s frame above desk home says ben lack sufficient impetus achieve anything worth while think learned anything s this that one else the author your potential you the only person that decide how far you and what you capable ladies and gentlemen that s story thank you very much
