scientific discoveries futurist juan enriquez notes demand shift code and our ability thrive depend our master that code here applies this notion the field genomics dna biotech business culture genetics invention science technology books transhuman juan enriquez genomics and our future supposed care you because s about fear right and you should really afraid but not for the reasons why you think you should you should really afraid that stick the first slide this thing there that you missing out because you spend this week thinking about iraq and thinking about bush and thinking about the stock market you going miss one the greatest adventure that ever been and this what this adventure s really about this crystallize dna every life form this planet every insect every bacteria every plant every animal every human every politician code that stuff and you want take single crystal dna looks like that and just beginning understand this stuff and this the single most exciting adventure that have ever been s the single greatest mapping project ever been you think that the mapping america s made difference land the moon this other stuff s the map ourselves and the map every plant and every insect and every bacteria that really makes difference and s beginning tell lot about evolution turns out that what this stuff and richard dawkins has written about this this really river out the billion base pair inside each your cells really history where you been for the past billion years and could start dating things and could start changing medicine and arche ology turns out that you take the human species about years ago white european diverge from black african very significant way white european were subject the plague and when they were subject the plague most people didn survive but those who survive had mutation the ccr receptor and that mutation was passed their kids because they the ones that survive there was great deal population pressure africa because you didn have these cities you didn have that ccr population pressure mutation can date years ago that one the reasons why aids raging across africa fast and not fast across europe and beginning find these little things for malaria for sick cell for cancer and the measure that map ourselves this the single greatest adventure that ever and this friday want you pull out really good bottle wine and want you these two people because this friday years ago watson and crick found the structure dna and that almost important date the february when first ourselves but anyway get that thought talk about the new zoo all you guys have heard about dna all the stuff that dna does but some the stuff discovering kind nifty because this turns out the single most abundant species the planet you think you successful cockroaches are successful turns out that there s ten trillion trillion pleurococcus sitting out there and didn know that pleurococcus was out there which part the reason why this whole species mapping project important because just beginning learn where came from and what are and finding amoeba like this this the amoeba dubia and the amoeba dubia doesn look like much except that each you has about billion letter which what makes you you far gene code inside each your cells and this little amoeba which you know water hundreds and millions and billion turns out have billion base pair gene code inside this little thingamajig has genome that s times the size your and you thinking efficient information storage mechanism may not turn out chips may turn out something that looks little like that amoeba and again learning from life and how life works this funky little thing people didn used think that was worth taking sample out nuclear actor because was dangerous and course nothing lived there and then finally somebody picked micro scope and looked the water that was sitting next the cores and sitting next that water the cores was this little deinococcus radiodurans doing back stroke having chromosome blown apart every day six seven times rest itch them living about times the radiation that would kill you and now you should getting hint how diverse and how important and how interesting this journey into life and how many different life forms there are and how there can different life forms living very different places maybe even outside this planet because you can live radiation that looks like this that bring whole series interesting questions this little thingamajig didn know this thingamajig existed should have known that this existed because this the only bacteria that you can see the naked eye this thing millimeter lives deep trench off the coast namibia and what you looking with this namibiens the biggest bacteria ever seen s about the size little period sentence again didn know this thing was there three years ago just beginning this journey life the new zoo this really odd one this ferroplasma the reason why ferroplasma interesting because eat iron lives inside the equivalent battery acid and excretes sulfuric acid when you think odd life forms when you think what takes live turns out this very efficient life form and they call archaea archaea means the ancient ones and the reason why they ancient because this thing came when this planet was covered things like sulfuric acid batteries and was eating iron when the earth was part melt core s not just dogs and cat and whale and dolphins that you should aware and interested this little journey your fear should that you are not that you paying attention stuff which temporal mean george bush s going gone right life isn whether the humans survive don survive these things are going living this planet other planets and s just beginning understand this code dna that s really the most exciting intellectual adventure that ever been and you can strange things with this stuff this baby gar conserv ation group gets together tries figure out how breed animal that s almost extinct they can natural what they with this thing they take spoon take some cells out adult gar s mouth code take the cells from that and insert into fertilized cow s egg program cow s egg different gene code when you that the cow gives birth gar are now experiment with ngos pandas elims sumatran tigers and the australia bless their heart are playing with these things now the last these things died september these are tasmanian tigers the last known one died the hobart zoo but turns out that learn more about gene code and how program species may able close the gene gap deterio rate dna and when learn how close the gene gap then can put full string dna together and that and insert this into fertilized wolf s egg may give birth animal that hasn walked the earth since and then you can start going back further and you can start thinking about and you can think about other species and other places like mary land they trying figure out what the primordial ancestor because each contain our entire gene code where been for the past billion years because evolved from that stuff you can take that tree life and collapse back and the measure that you learn program maybe give birth something that very close the first primordial ooze and s all coming out things that look like this these are companies that didn exist five years ago huge gene sequencing facilities the size foot ball fields some are public some are private takes about billion dollars sequence human being the first time takes about million dollars the second time will have dollar genome within the next five eight years that means each you will contain your entire gene code and will really boring will read like this the really neat thing about this stuff that s life and laurie s going talk about this one little bit because you happen find this one inside your body you big trouble because that s the source code for ebola that s one the dead diseases known humans but plants work the same way and insects work the same way and this apple works the same way this apple the same thing this floppy disk because this thing code ones and zero and this thing code and there absorb energy tree and one fine day has enough energy say execute and goes hump right and when does that pushes what does execute the first line code which read just like that aatcagggaccc and that means make root next line code make stem next line code tacgggg make flower that s white that bloom the spring that smell like this the measure that you have the code and the measure that you read and the way the first plant was read two years ago the first human was read two years ago the first insect was read two years ago the first thing that ever read was little bacteria called haemophilus influenza the measure that you have the source code all you know you can change the source code and you can program life forms that this little thing becomes vaccine this little thing starts producing materials which why dupont now growing form polyester that feel like silk corn this changes all rules this life but reprogramming this what you look like this one your chromosome and what you can now you can exactly what your chromosome and what the gene code that chromosome right here and what those genes code for and what animals they code against and then you can tie the literature and the measure that you can that you can home today and get the internet and access the world s biggest public library which library life and you can some pretty strange things because the same way you can program this apple you cliff s lab the harvard medical school s reprogramming chicken embryo grow more wing why would cliff doing that doesn have restaurant the reason why s reprogramming that animal have more wing because when you used play with lizard little child and you picked the lizard sometimes the tail fell off but grew not human beings you cut off arm you cut off leg doesn grow but because each your cells contain your entire gene code each cell can programmed don stop stem cell research and don stop genomic research express different body function and the measure that learn how chicken grow wing and what the program for those cells differentiate one the things going able stop differentiate cells which you know cancer and one the things going learn how how program cells like stem cells such way that they express bone stomach skin pancreas and you are likely wandering around and your children grown body parts reasonable period time some places the world where they don stop the research how s this stuff work each you differ from the person next you one thousand but only three percent code which means s only one thousand times three percent very small difference expression and punctuation can make significant difference take simple declar ative sentence right that s perfectly clear men read that sentence and they look that sentence and they read this okay now women look that sentence and they say wrong this the way should seen that s what your genes are doing that s why you differ from this person over here one thousand right but you know s reason ably good looking but won there you can this stuff even without changing the punctuation you can look this right and they look the world little different they look the same world and they say that s how the same gene code that s why you have genes mice have genes husband have genes mice and men are the same wives know that but anyway you can make very small changes gene code and get really different comes even with the same string letter that s what your genes are doing every day that s why sometimes person s genes don have change lot get cancer these little hippie these things are the size credit card they will test any one you for genetic conditions that bring questions privacy and ability and all kinds stuff but also allows start going after diseases because you run person who has leukemia through something like this turns out that three diseases with completely similar clinical syndrome are completely different diseases because all leukemia that set genes over there over express s the middle set genes and s the bottom set genes and one those particular things express your body then you take gleevec and you cur not express your body you don have one those types particular one those types don take gleevec won anything for you same thing with receptin you got breast cancer don have her receptor don take receptin changes the nature medicine changes the prediction medicine changes the way medicine works the greatest repository knowledge when most went college was this thing and turns out that this not important any more the s library congress terms printed volume data contain less data than coming out good genomics company every month compound basis let say that again single genomics company generate more data month compound basis than the printed collection the library congress this what s been power the s economy s moore s law all you know that the price computers halve every months and the power double right except that when you lay that side side with the speed with which gene data s being deposited bank moore s law right here s the blue line this log scale and that s what super exponential growth means this going push computers have grow faster than they been growing because far there haven been application that have been require that need faster than moore s law this stuff does and here s interesting map this map which was finished the harvard business school one the really interesting questions all this data s free who s using this the greatest public library the world well turns out that there s about trillion bit moving inside from the united states the united states about trillion going over those european countries about s going japan there s almost communication between japan and nobody else literate this stuff s free one s reading they focus the war they focus bush they not interested life this what new map the world looks like that the genomic ally literate world and that problem fact s not genomic ally literate world you can break this out states and you can watch states rise and fall depending their ability speak language life and you can watch new york fall off cliff and you can watch new jersey fall off cliff and you can watch the rise the new empire intelligence and you can break out counties because s specific counties and you want get more specific s actually specific zip code you want know where life happening well southern california s happening and that s and that s the triangle between salk scripps and s called rrey road that means you don need big nation successful means you don need lot people successful and means you can move most the wealth country about three four carefully picked s same thing massachusetts looks more spread out but the way the ones that are the same color are contiguous what s the net effect this agricultural society the difference between the richest and the poorest the most productive and the least productive was five one why because agriculture you had kids and you grow little bit earlier and you work little bit harder you could produce about five times more wealth average than your neighbor knowledge society that number now really matter you literate not just reading and writing english and french and german but microsoft and linux and apple and very soon s going matter you literate life code there something you should fear s that you not keeping your eye the ball because really matter who speak life that s why nations rise and fall and turns out that you went back the s the most productive nation earth was australia per person and new land was way there and then the s came about and then switzerl about and then the s got back top beat their chocolate and cuckoo clock and today course you all know that the most productive nation earth embourg producing about one third more wealth per person per year than america tiny land locked state oil diamonds natural resource just smart people moving bit different rules here s different productivity rates here s how many people takes produce single s patent about americans korean brits argentines you want know why argentina s crash s got nothing with inflation s got nothing with ization you can take harvard educated ivy league economist stick him charge argentina still crashes the country because doesn understand how the rules have changed yeah and takes about million indian well watch what happens india india and china used percent the global economy just the industrial revolution and they are now about percent two billion people one third the global population producing percent the wealth because they didn get this change because they kept treating their people like serfs instead like share holders common project they didn keep the people who were educated they didn ment the business they didn the silicon valley did and that s why they say that silicon valley has been power not integrated circuit indian and chinese here s what s happening the world turns out that you gone the when was founded there were countries this world turns out there s now about country after country split sec succeed fail and s all getting very fragmented and this has not stopped the s these are sovereign states that did not exist before and this doesn include fusion name changes changes flag generating about states per year people are taking control their own states sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse and the really interesting thing you and your kids are empower build great empire and you don need lot and given that the music over was going talk about how you can use this generate lot wealth and how code works juan enriquez going stop there and next year because don want take any laurie s time but thank you very much
