designer ross lovegrove pounds his philosophy fat free design and offer sight into several his extraordinary products including the water bottle and the chair dna arts biology creativity design industrial design invention nature product design transportation ross lovegrove shares organic design name lovegrove only know nine lovegrove two which are parents they are first cousins and you know what happens when you know there s terribly weird freaky side which fighting with all the time try and get through today kind discipline myself with minute talk was hanging have pee thought perhaps was hanging long enough that would guide through the minutes okay known captain organic and that s philosophical position well aesthetic position but today what like talk you about that love form and how form can touch people s soul and emotion not very long ago not many thousands years ago actually lived cave and don think lost that coding system respond well form but interested creating intelligent form not interested all blobism any that superficial rubbish that you see coming out design these this artificial induced consumer think s atroc ious world the world people like amory lovins janine benyus james watson that world but work purely instinctive not scientist could have been perhaps but work this world where trust instinct century trans technology into products that use everyday and relate beautiful and natural with and should developing things should developing pack aging for ideas which elevate people s perception and respect for the things that dig out the earth and translate into products for everyday use the water bottle begin with this concept what call dna dna design nature art these are the three things that condition world here drawing leonardo vinci years ago before photography shows how observation curiosity and instinct work create amazing art industrial design the art form the century people like leonardo there have not been many had this amazing instinctive curiosity work from similar position don want sound ious saying that but this drawing made digital pad couple years ago well into the century years later s impression water impression being the most valuable art form the planet know million dollars easily for monet use now whole new process few years ago invented process keep with people like greg lynn main zaha koolhaas all these people that think are perseve ring and pioneer with fantastic new ideas how create form this all created digital here you see the the mill block acrylic this what show the client say that s what want that point don know that s possible all s seductor but just feel bone that that s possible look the tool look how that produced these are the invisible things that you never see your life this the background noise industrial design that like poor flow through richard serra more valuable than the product eyes don have one when make some money have one machine for myself this the final product when they sent thought failed felt like nothing has feel like nothing was when put the water that realized that put skin water itself s icon water itself and elevate people s perception contemporary design each bottle different meaning the water level will give you different shape s mass individual from single product fits the hand fits arthritic hands fits children s hands makes the product strong the ation s mill efiori ideas the future they will look like that because need move away from those type polymer and use that for medical equipment and more important things perhaps life biopolymers these new ideas for materials will come into play probably decade doesn look cool does but can live that don have problem with that design for that condition biopolymers s the future took this video cape town last year this the freaky side coming out have this special interest things like this which blow mind don know whether you know drop knee cry don know what think but just know that nature improve with ever greater purpose that which once existed and that strange ness consequence innovative thinking when look these things they look pretty normal but these things evolved over many years and now what trying get three weeks design telephone how the hell telephone three weeks when you get these things that take hundreds million years evolve how you dense that comes back instinct not talking about designing telephone that look like that and not looking designing architecture like that just interested natural growth patterns and the beautiful forms that only nature really create how that flow through and how that comes out what trying understand this through the human fore s then blown through rapid prototyping reveal the cellular structure have these office office mixture the natural history museum and nasa space lab s weird kind freaky place this one spec imens this made bone made from mixture organic mineral and polymer studied cooking school for four years and that experience which was called domestic science was bit cheap trick for try and get science qualification actually put marijuana everything cook and had access all the best girls was fabulous all the guys the team couldn understand but anyway this meringue this another sample have meringue made exactly the same way estimation bone s made from polysaccharides and proteins you pour water that dissolve could manufacturing from food stuff the future not bad idea don know need talk janine and few other people about that but believe instinctive that that meringue can become something car don know also interested growth patterns the unbridled way that nature grow things you not strict form all these inter related forms they inspire everything although might end making something incredibly simple this detail chair that designed magnesium shows this inter locuti element and the beauty kind engineering and biological thinking shown pretty much bone structure any one those element you could sort hang the wall some kind art object s the world s first chair made magnesium cost million dollars develop s called rnhardt went into time magazine the new language the century boy for somebody growing wales little village that s enough shows how you make one holistic form like the car industry and then you break what you need this absolutely beautiful way working s god way working s organic and s essential s absolutely fat free design and when you look you see human beings bless you when that move into polymer you can change the elastic the the form this idea for gas injected one piece polymer chair what nature does drill hole things liber ates form takes away anything extraneous that s what make organic things which are essential don and they look funky too but don set out make funky things because think that s absolute disgrace set out look natural forms you took the idea fractal technology further take membrane shrinking down constantly like nature does that could seat for chair could for sports shoe could car blending into seats wow let s for that s the kind stuff this what exists nature observation now allows bring that natural process into the design process every day that s what this show that s currently tokyo s called super liquid s sculptural investigation s like century henry moore when you see henry moore still your hair stand there s some amazing spiritual connect was car designer phew all driving one his day was the highest taxpayer britain that the power organic design contribute immense our sense being our sense relationship with things our sensuality and you know the sort even the sort erotic side which very important this work this all process these actually are sold work they very big prints but this how get that object ironically that object was made the kill arney process which brand new process here for the century and can hear greg lynn laughing his off say that tell you about that later when look into these data images see new things self s self inspired atomic structure radio aria the things that couldn see but can now these again are cor out they made virtually from nothing they made from silica why not structure from cars like that all these natural forces take away what they don need and they deliver maximum beauty need that realm want stuff like that this new chair which should come the market september s for company called moro italy s gas injected polymer chair those hole you see there are very filter down water down version the extrem the atomic structure goes with the flow the polymer and you see there s image coming right now that shows the full thing s great have companies italy who support this way dreaming you see the shadow that come through that they actually probably more important than the product but s the minimum takes the cor out the back let you breathe takes away any material you don need and actually garners flexure too was going break into dance then this some current work doing looking single surface structure and how they flow how they stretch and flow s based furniture typo logies but that s not the end motivation s made from aluminum opposed aluminium and s grown s grown mind and then s grown terms the whole process that through this two weeks ago ccp entry who build parts for ntleys and s being built speak and will show phil lips next year new york have big show with phil lips auction when see these animation jesus blown away this what goes studio everyday walk travel come back some guy s got that computer there s this like good ness try create this energy invention every day studio this kind effervescent fully charged sense that deliver ideas single surface products furniture s good one how you grow legs out surface would love build this one day and perhaps like build also out sugar polymer wood chips don know human hair don know love that don know just got some time that s the weird side coming out again and lot companies don understand that three weeks ago was with tokyo they said give the dream what our dream how beat apple said well you don copy apple that s for sure said you get into biopolymers they looked straight through what waste anyway s true fuck fuck you know mean deliver they not taking had this image years had this image water droplet for years sitting hot bed that image car for that s the car the future s water droplet been bang about this like can believe cars are all wrong going show you something bit weird now they laughed everywhere over the world showed this the only place that didn laugh was moscow cars are made from components how ridiculous that couldn you make that from s got vacuum formed carbon nylon pan everything s holistic ally integrated open and close like bread bin there engine there s solar panel the back and there are batteries the wheels they fitted like form one you take them off your wall you plug them off you jolly well three wheel car slow feminine transparent you can see the people there you drive different you see that thing you you and not anaesthet ized separate from life there s hole the front and there s reason for that s city car you drive along you get out you drive probosc you get out lift you present the solar panel the sun and night s street lamp that s what happens you get inspired the street lamp first and then the car second these bubble can see these bubble with these hydrogen pack ages floating around the ground driven when showed this south africa everybody after was going yeah hey car stick like this can you imagine car stick you put next contemporary architecture feel totally natural and that s what with furniture not putting charles eames furniture buildings anymore that move trying build furniture that fits architecture trying build transportation systems work aircraft for the whole thing all this sort stuff trying force these natural inspired nature dream home going finish two things this the steriolith ography stair case s little bit dedication james james watson built this thing for studio cost dollars build this most people and buy the martin built this this the data that goes with that incredibly complex took about two years because looking for fat free design lean efficient things healthy products this built composite s single element which rotate around create holistic element and this carbon fiber handrail which only support two places modern materials allow modern things this shot the studio this how looks pretty much every day you wouldn want have fear height coming down there virtually handrail doesn pass any standards who care yeah and has internal handrail which gives s strength s this holistic integration that s studio s terra s hill next all the crap you know the prostitutes and all that stuff s next david hockney s original studio has light system that changes throughout the day guys out for lunch the door s open they come back because s normally rain and they prefer stay this studio elephant skull from oxford university bought that last year they very difficult find would anybody s got whale skeleton they want sell put the studio just going inter ject little bit with some the things that you see the video s home made video made myself three clock the morning just show you how real world you never see that you never see architects designers showing you their real world this called plasnet s bio polycarbonate new chair doing italy world s first bamboo bike with fold handle bars should all rid one these china buy all these crappy cars should rid things like this counter balance like say s cross between natural history museum and nasa laboratory s full prototypes and objects s self inspiration again mean the rare times when there enjoy and get lots kids coming lots and lots kids coming contaminat for all those children investment bank wankers this sorry that s solar seed s concept for new architecture that thing the top the world s first solar power garden lamp the first produced giles revell should talking here today amazing photography things you can see the first sculptural model made for that thing tokyo lots stuff there s little leaf chair that gold looking thing called leaf s made from kevlar the wall book called super natural which allows remember what done because there s ated brick did limoges last year concept for new ceramics architecture unclear working three clock the morning and don pay over time over time the passion design join the club don s true s true people like and greg travel like you can fit all don know how next week electro sweden then beijing friday you work that one out and when see ed s photograph think why the hell going china s true s true because there s soul this whole thing need have new instinct for the century need combine all this stuff all the people who were talking over this period worked car together would joy absolute joy there s new light system doing japan there s tuareg shoes from north africa there s these are sculpture copper jel sounds like some quiz show something doesn s going end thank you james for your great inspiration thank you very much
