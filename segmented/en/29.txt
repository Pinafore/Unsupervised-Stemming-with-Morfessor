the gang before that just one warning which that this presentation has been rated the motion picture association america contain adult themes adult language given who the stage you light know that fact there ring unexpected ward function side let start talking about crack cocaine and how transform the gang and that you have actually back time before crack cocaine the early s and look from the perspective gang leader being gang leader the inner city wasn such bad deal the mid s the early s some would say now you had lot power and you got beat people you got lot prestige lot respect but there was money the gang had way make money and you couldn charge due the people the gang because the people the gang didn have any money you couldn really make any money selling marijuana marijuana s too cheap turns out you can get rich selling marijuana you couldn sell cocaine you know cocaine s great product powder cocaine but you got know rich white people and most the inner city gang member didn know any rich white people they couldn sell that market you couldn really petty crime either turns out petty crime s terrible way make living result gang leader you had you know power s pretty good life but the thing was the end you were living home with your mother and wasn really career was something that s just there were limits how powerful and important you could you had live home with your mother then along comes crack cocaine and the words malcolm glad well crack cocaine was the extra chunky version tomato sauce for the inner city because crack cocaine was unbelievable innovation don have time talk about today but you think about would say that the last twenty five years every invention innovation that s occurred this country the biggest one terms impact the well being people who live the inner city was crack cocaine and for the worse not for the better but for the worse had huge impact life what was about crack cocaine was brilliant way getting the brain high because you could smoke crack cocaine you can smoke powder cocaine and smoking much more efficient mechanism deliver high than snort and turned out there was this audience that didn know wanted crack cocaine but when came really did and was perfect drug you could sell for buy the cocaine that went into for dollar sell for five dollars highly addictive the high was very short for fifteen minutes you get this great high and then when you come down all you want get high again created wonderful market and for the people who were there running the gang was great way seemingly make lot money least for the people the top this where enter the picture not really really bit player all this author sudhir venkatesh the main character was math major college who had good heart and decided wanted get sociology came the university chicago now the three months before came chicago had spent following the grateful dead and his own words looked like freak s south asian very dark skin south asian big man and had hair his words down his defied all kinds boundaries was black white was man woman was really curious sight seen showed the university chicago and the famous sociologist william julius wilson was doing book that involved survey people all across chicago and took one look sudhir who was going some survey for him and decided knew exactly the place send him which was one the tough most ious housing projects and not just chicago but the entire united states sudhir the suburban boy who had never really been the inner city duti fully took his clip board and you know walked down this housing project gets the first building the first building well there s nobody there but hear some voices the stair well climb the stair well and comes around the corner find group young african american men playing dice this about peak the crack epidemic this very dangerous job being gang you don like surprise you don like surprise people who come around the corner and the mantra was shoot first ask questions later now sudhir was lucky was such freak and that clip board probably saved his life because they figured other rival gang member would coming shoot them with clip board his greeting was not particularly warm but they did say well let s hear your questions your survey kid you not the first question the survey that was sent ask was how you feel about being poor and black america makes you wonder about academic the choice answer were very good good bad and very bad what sudhir found out fact that the real answer was the following the survey was not the end going what got sudhir off the hook was held host over night the stair well there was lot fire there were lot philosophical discussion had with the gang member morning the gang leader arrived check out sudhir decided was threat and they let him home sudhir went home took show took nap and you and probably faced with the situation would think well guess going write dissert ation the grateful dead been following them for the last three months sudhir the other hand got right back walked down the housing project went the floor the second floor and said hey guys had much fun hanging out with you last night wonder could again night and that was the beginning what turned out beautiful relationship that involved sudhir living the housing project and off for years hanging out crack house going jail with the gang member having the car windows shot out his car having the police break into his apartment and steal his computer disk you name but ultimately the story has happy ending for sudhir who became one the most respect sociologist the country and especially for office with excel spread sheet open waiting for sudhir come and deliver the latest load data that would get from the gang was one the most unequal author relationship ever but was glad the beneficiary what find what find the gang well let say one thing really got access everybody the gang got inside look the gang from the very bottom the very top they trust sudhir ways that really academic has ever really anybody any outside has ever earn the trust these gang the point where they actually opened what was most interesting for their books their financial records that they kept and they made them available and not only could study them but could ask them questions about what was them have kind summarize very quickly the short time have what the sort bottom line what take away from the gang that had draw parallel between the gang and any other organization would that the gang just like mcdonald s lot different respect the restaurant mcdonald s first one way which isn maybe the most interesting way but s good way start the way s organized the hierarchy the gang the way looks here s what the org chart the gang looks like don know any you know very much about org chart but you were assign stripped down and simpl ified mcdonald s org chart this exactly what the org chart would look like now s amazing but the top level the gang they actually call themselves the board director and sudhir says s not like these guys had very sophisticated kind view like what happened american corporate life but they had seen movie like wall street and they kind had learned little bit about what was like the real world now below that board director you got essentially what are regional vps people who control say the south side chicago the west side chicago now sudhir got know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assign ment trying take the iowa franchise which turned out for this black gang was not one the more brilliant financial endeavor that they under took but the thing that really makes the gang seem like mcdonald s franchise that the guys who are running you know the local gang the four square block four square block areas they just like the guys some sense who are running the mcdonald s they are the entrepreneur they get the exclusive property rights control the drug selling they get the name the gang behind them for merchandis and marketing and they the ones who basically make the profit lose profit depending how good they are running the business now the group really want you think about though are the ones the bottom the foot soldiers these are the teenager typically who standing out the street corner selling the drugs extremely dangerous work and important note that almost all the weight all the people this organization are the bottom just like mcdonald s some sense the foot soldiers are lot like the people who are taking your order mcdonald s and indeed s not just chance that they like them fact these neighborhood they the same people the same kids who are working the gang were actually the very same time they would typically working part time place like mcdonald s which already think fore shadow the main result that talked about about what crappy job was being the gang because obviously being the gang were such wonderful lucrative job why the world would these guys moon light mcdonald s what the wages look like you might surprise but based the actual you know being able talk them and see their records this what looks like terms the wages the hour wage the foot soldiers were earn was hour was below the minimum wage and this well document s easy see the patterns consumption they have really not fiction s fact there was very little money the gang especially the bottom now you managed rise say and that local leader the guy who s the equivalent the mcdonald s franchise you making dollars year and that some ways was the best job you could hope get you were growing one these neighborhood young black male you managed rise the very top dollars year what you hope make truly you would great success story and one the sad parts this that indeed among the many other ramification crack cocaine that the most talent individual these communities this what they were striving for they weren trying make legitimate ways because there were legitimate channel out this was the best way out and actually was the right choice probably try make out this way you look this the relationship mcdonald s break down here the money looks about the same why such bad job well the reason s such bad job that there s somebody shooting you lot the time with shooting you what are the death rates found our gang and admit this was not really sort standard situation this was time intense violence lot gang war this gang actually became quite successful but there were cost and the death rate not mention the rate being arrested sent prison being wounded the death rate our sample was seven percent per person per year you the gang for four years you expect die with about percent likelihood that about high you can get for comparison s purpose let s think about some other walk life where you may expect might extremely risk like let s say that you were murder and you were vict murder and you sent death row turns out the death rates death row from all causes including execution two percent year s lot safe being death row than selling drugs out the street that makes you pause gives you some pause those you who believe that death penalty s going have enormous deter rent effect crime now give you sense just how bad the inner city was during crack and not really focus the negative but really there s another story tell you there you look the death rates just random young black male growing the inner city the united states the death rates during crack were about one percent that s extremely high and this violent death s unbelievable some sense put into perspective you compare this the soldiers iraq for instance right now fighting the war percent some very literal way the young black men who were growing this country were living war zone very much the sense the way that the soldiers over iraq are fighting war why the world you might ask would anybody willing stand out street corner selling drugs for hour with percent chance dying over the next four years why would they that and think there are couple answer think the first one that they got fool history used the gang was rite passage that the young people controlled the gang that you got older you dropped out the gang what happened was the people who happened the right place the right time the people who happened leading the gang the mid late s became very very wealthy and the logical thing think was that well the next generation they going age out the gang like everybody else has and the next generation going take over and get the wealth there are striking similar ities think the internet boom right the first set people silicon valley got very very rich and then all friends said maybe should that too and they were willing work very cheap for stock options that never came some sense that s what happened exactly the set people were looking that they were willing start the bottom just like say lawyer law firm first year lawyer ling start the bottom work hour weeks for not that much money because they think they going make partner but what happened was the rules changed and they never got make partner indeed the same people who were running all the major gang the late s are still running the major gang chicago today they never passed any the wealth everybody got stuck that hour job and turned out disaster the other thing the gang was very very good was marketing and trick and for instance one thing the gang would you know the gang leaders would have big ages and they drive fancy cars and have fancy jewelry what sudhir eventually realized hung out with them more that really they didn own those cars they just lease them because they couldn afford own the fancy cars and they didn really have gold jewelry they had gold plate jewelry goes back you know the real real versus the fake real and really they did all sorts things trick the young people into thinking what great deal the gang was going for instance they would give year old kid they give him whole you know roll bill hold that year old kid would say well you know would say his friends hey look all the money got the gang wasn his money until spent and then essentially was debt the gang and was sort dentured servant for while have couple minutes let one last thing hadn thought have time which talk about what learned more generally about economics from the study the gang economists tend talk technical words often our ories fail quite miserably when the data but actually what s kind interesting that this setting turned out that some the economic ories that worked not well the real economy worked very well the drug economy some sense because s unfettered capital here s economic principle this one the basic ideas labor economics called compensating different s the idea that basically the ment wages that work require leave him different between perform two task one which more pleasant than the other that s what you call compensating different s why think garbage men might paid more than people who work parks the words one the member the gang think makes this clear turns out sort getting ahead myself turns out the gang when there s war going that they actually pay the foot soldiers twice much money s exactly this concept because they not willing risk and the words gang member capture quite nice says would you stand around here when all this shit that means shooting all this shit s going right going asked put life the line then front the cash man essentially think the gang member says much more articulately than does the economist about what s going here s another one economists talk about game theory that every two person game has ilibrium here s the translation you get from the gang member they talking about the decision why they don shoot one thing that turns out great business tactic the gang you and just shoot the air just shoot guns the other gang s territory all the people are afraid buy their drugs there they going come into your neighborhood but here s what says about why they don that says start shooting around there the other gang s territory nobody and mean you dig nobody going step their turf but gotta careful because they can shoot around here too and then all fuck that s exactly the same concept but then again sometimes economists get wrong one thing observ the data that looked like terms the gang leader always got paid matter how bad was economically always got himself paid had some ories related cash flow and lack access capital market and things like that but then asked the gang member well why you always get paid and your workers don always get paid his response you got all these niggers below you who want your job you dig you start taking loss they see you weak and shit and thought about and said ceo often pay themselves million dollar uses even when companies are losing lot money and never would really occur economist that this idea weak and shit could really important but maybe maybe weak and shit maybe weak and shit important hypothesis that needs more analysis thank you very much
