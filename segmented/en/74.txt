worldchanging com found alex steffen argue that reducing humanity s ecological footprint incredibly vital now the western consumer lifestyle spread developing countries alternative energy business cities collaboration culture design environment global issues invention sustainability technology third world urban planning alex steffen see sustainable future when starting talk like this usually whole spiel about sustainability because lot people out there don know what that this crowd that does know what like just like the second crib note version right just bear with real fast you know fill the blank you know sustainability small planet right picture little earth cling around the sun you know about million years ago bunch monkey fell out trees got little clever harness fire invented the printing press made you know gage with wheels and you know built the society that now live unfortunately while this society without doubt the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created s got some major major laws one them that every society has ecological footprint has amount impact the planet that s measur able how much stuff goes through your life how much waste left behind you and the moment our society have really dramatically sustainable level this using about five planets everybody the planet lived the way did need between five six seven some people even say planets make clearly don have planets again you know mental visual planets one planet planets one planet right don have that that s one problem the second problem that the planet that have being used wild fair ways right north americans such myself you know basically sort wallowing glut hog and eating all sorts stuff and you know then you get all the way down people who live the asia pacific region even more africa and people simply not have enough survive this producing all sorts tension all sorts dynamic that are deeply disturbing and there s more and more people the way right this what the planet s going look like years s going pretty crowd place least eight billion people make matter even more difficult s very young planet third the people this planet are kids and those kids are growing completely different way than their parents did matter where they live they been expose this idea our society our prosperity and they may not want live exactly like they may not want americans brits german south african but they want their own version life which more prosperous and more dynamic and more you know enjoy able and all these things combine create enormous amount torque the planet and cannot figure out way deal with that torque are going find ourselves more and more and more quickly facing situation which are simply unthinkable everybody this room has heard the worst case scenarios don need into that but will ask the question what s the alternative and would say that the moment the alternative unimaginable you know the one hand have the unthinkable the other hand have the unimaginable don know yet how build society which environmentally sustainable which share able with everybody the planet which promote stability and democracy and human rights and which achievable the time frame necessary make through the challenge face don know how this yet what s worldchanging well worldchanging you might think being bit news service for the unimaginable future you know what out there doing looking for examples tools models and ideas which widely adopted would change the game lot times when talk like this talk about things that everybody this room sure has already heard but most people haven thought today something little different and talk about what looking for rather than saying you know rather than giving you tried and true examples talk about the kinds things coping out give you little peek into our editor note book and given that have minutes this this going kind quick don know just stick with right first all what are looking for bright green city one the biggest levers that have the developed world for changing the impact that have the planet changing the way that live cities already urban planet that s especially true the developed world and people who live cities the developed world tend very prosperous and thus use lot stuff can change the dynamic first all creating cities that are dense and more able here for example vancouver which you haven been there you ought for visit s fabulous city and they are doing density new density better than probably anybody else the planet right now they actually aging talk north americans out driving cars which pretty great thing you have density you also have growth management you leave side what natural natural this port land that actual development that land there will remain past perpetu they bounded the city with line nature city nothing changes once you those things you can start making all sorts investment you can start doing things like you know trans systems that actually work transport people effective and reason ably comfortable you can also start change what you build this the dding zero energy development london which one the green buildings the world s fabulous place able now build buildings that generate all their own electricity that cycle much their water that are much more comfortable than standard buildings use all natural light etc and over time cost less green roof bill mcdonough covered that last night won well that too much but once you also have people living close proximity each other one the things you can information technologies develop you can start have smart places you can start know where things are when you know where things are becomes easier share them when you share them you end using less one great example car share club which are really starting take off the s have already taken off many places europe and are great example you somebody who drive you know one day week you really need your own car another thing that information technology let start figuring out how use less stuff know and monitor the amount actually using here s power cord which glows bright the more energy that you use which think pretty cool concept although think ought work the other way around that gets bright the more you don use but you know there may even simpler approach could just label things this light switch that read the one hand flash flood and the other hand off how build things can change well this bio morph building takes inspiration form from life many these buildings are incredibly beautiful and also much more effective this example bio mimicry which something really starting look lot more for this case you have shell design which was used create new kind exhaust fan which great more effective there s lot this stuff happening s really pretty remarkable encourage you look worldchanging you into starting cover this more and more there s also neo biological design where more and more actually using life itself and the processes life become part our industry this for example hydrogen generating algae have model potential emerging model that looking for how take the cities most live and turn them into bright green cities but unfortunately most the people the planet don live the cite live they live the emerging mega cities the developing world and there s statistic often like use which that adding city seattle every four days city the size seattle the planet every four days was giving talk about two months ago and this guy who done some work with the came and was really ster and said look you got that totally wrong s totally wrong s every seven days adding city the size seattle every seven days and most those cities look more like this than the city that you live most those cite are growing incredibly quickly they don have existing infrastructure they have enormous number people who are struggling with poverty and enormous number people are trying figure out how things new ways what need order make developing nation mega cities into bright green mega cities well the first thing need need leapfrogging and this one the things that are looking for everywhere the idea behind leapfrogging that you are person country who stuck situation where you don have the tools and technologies that you need there s reason for you invest last generation s technologies right that you much better off almost universal looking for low cost local applicable version the technology one place all familiar with seeing this with cell phones right all throughout the developing world people are going directly cell phones skip ping the whole land line stage there are land lines many developing world cities they usually pretty crappy systems that break down lot and cost enormous amount money rather like this picture here particularly like the ganesh the background talking the cell phone what have increasing cell phones just ating out through society heard all about this here this week won say too much more than that other than say what true for cell phones true for all sorts technologies the second thing tools for collaboration they systems collaboration intellectual property systems which encourage collaboration right when you have free ability for people freely work together and innovate you get different kinds solutions and those solutions are accessible different way people who don have capital right you know have open source software have creative common and other kinds copy left solutions and those things lead things like this this telecentro sao paulo this pretty remarkable program using free and open source software cheap sort hack together machines and basically sort abandoned buildings has put together bunch community center where people can come get high speed internet access learn computer program skills for free and quarter million people every year use these now sao paulo and those quarter million people are some the poorest people sao paolo particularly like the little linux pengu the back one the things that that s leading sort southern cultural explosion and one the things really really interested worldchanging the ways which the south identify itself and categoriz itself ways that have less and less with most this room s not you know bol wood isn just answer hollywood right you know brazil music scene isn just answer the major label s doing something new there s new things happening there s inter play between them and you know you get amazing things like don know any you have seen the movie city god yeah s fabulous movie you haven seen and s all about this question very artistic and direct kind way you have other radical examples where the ability use cultural tools spread out these are people who have just been visited the internet book mobile uganda and who are waving their first books the air which just think that s pretty cool picture you know you also have the ability for people start coming together and acting their own behalf political and civic ways ways that haven happened before and heard last night heard earlier this week are absolutely fundamentally vital the ability craft new solutions got craft new political realities and would personally say that have craft new political realities not only places like india afghanistan kenya pakistan what have you but here home well another world possible and sort the big the anti global ization movement right weak that lot talk about how another world isn just possible another world s here that s not just that have sort imagine there being different vague possibility out there but need start acting little bit more that possibility need start doing things like lula president brazil how many people knew lula before today much much better than the average crowd can tell you that lula s full problems full contradict ions but one the things that s doing putting forward idea how engage international relations that completely shift the balance from the standard sort north south dialogue into whole new way global collaboration would keep your eye this fellow another example this sort second super power thing the rise these games that are what call serious play looking lot this this spread everywhere this from force more powerful s little screen shot force more powerful video game that while you playing teaches you how engage non violent surrecti and regime change here s another one this from game called food force which game that teaches children how run refugee camp these things are all contributing very dynamic way huge rise especially the developing world people s interest and passion for democracy get little news about the developing world that often that there are literally millions people out there struggling change things fair free more democratic less corrupt and you know don hear those stories enough but s happening all over the place and these tools are part what s making possible now when you add all those things together when you add together leapfrogging and new kinds tools you know second super power stuff etc what you get well very quickly you get bright green future for the developing world you get for example green power spread throughout the world you get this building india s the green building the world you get grassroots solutions things that work for people who have capital limited access you get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panel into the remote mountain you get access distance medicine these are indian nurses learning how use pdas access database that have information that they don have access home distant you get new tools for people the developing world these are led light that help the roughly billion people out there for whom night fall means dark ness have new means operating these are refrigerators that require electricity they pot within pot design and you get water solutions water s one the most press problems here s design for harvest rain water that s super cheap and available people the developing world here s design for distill water using sunlight here s fog catch which you live moi jungle like area will distill water from the air that s clean and drink able here s way transport water just love this you know mean carrying water such drag and somebody just came with the idea well what you roll right mean that s great design this fabulous invention life straw basically you can suck any water through this and will become drink able the time hits your lips you know people who are desperate traits can get this this one favorite worldchanging kinds things ever this merry round invented the company round about which pump water kids play you know seriously give that one hand s pretty great and the same thing true for people who are absolute crisis right expecting have ward million refugee the year because climate change and political stability how help people like that well there s all sorts amazing new humanitarian design that are being developed collaborative ways all across the planet some those design include models for acting such new models for village instruction the middle refugee camp new models for pedagogy for the displace and have new tools this one absolute favorite things anywhere does anyone know what this audience detect land mine alex steffen exactly this land mine detect flower you are living one the places where the roughly half billion account for mine are scatte you can these seeds out into the field and they grow they will grow around the mine their roots will detect the chemical them and where the flower turn red you don step yeah seeds that could save your life you know also love because seems that the example the tools use change the world ought beautiful themselves you know that s not just enough survive got make something better than what got and think that will just wrap the immortal words well think that better things are the way think that fact that all the past but the beginning beginning all that the human mind has accomplish but the dream before the awakening hope that that turns out true the people this room have given more confidence than ever that will thank you very much
