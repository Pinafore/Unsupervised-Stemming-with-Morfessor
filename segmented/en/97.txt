dan gilbert author bling happiness challenge the idea that miserable don get what want our psychological immune system let feel truly happy even when things don planned brain choice culture evolution happiness psychology science dan gilbert asks why are happy when you have minutes speak two million years seems like really long time but evolution rily two million years nothing and yet two million years the human brain has nearly tripled mass going from the one and quarter pound brain our ancestor here habil the almost three pound loaf that everybody here has between their ears what about big brain that nature was eager for every one have one well turns out when brains triple size they don just get three times bigger they gain new structure and one the main reasons our brain got big because got new part called the frontal lobe and particularly part called the pre frontal cortex now what does pre frontal cortex for you that should just the entire architectural over haul the human skull the link evolutionary time well turns out the pre frontal cortex does lots things but one the most important things does experience simulator flight pilots practice flight simulator that they don make real mistakes planes human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experience their head before they try them out real life this trick that none our ancestor could and that other animal can quite like can s marvelous adaptation s there with opposable thumb and standing right and language one the things that got our species out the trees and into the shopping now all you have done this mean you know ben and jerry s doesn have liver and ice cream and s not because they whip some tried and went yuck s because without leaving your chair you can simulate that flavor and say yuck before you make let s see how your experience simulator are working let s just run quick diagnostic before proceed with the rest the talk here s two different future that invite you contemplat and you can try simulate them and tell which one you think you might prefer one them winning the lottery this about million dollars and the other becoming paraplegic just give moment thought you probably don feel like you need moment thought interesting there are data these two groups people data how happy they are and this exactly what you expect isn but these aren the data made these these are the data you failed the pop quiz and you hardly five minutes into the lecture because the fact that year after losing the use their legs and year after winning the lottery winners and paraplegic are equally happy with their lives now don feel too bad about fail the first pop quiz because everybody fail all the pop quiz all the time the research that laboratory has been doing that economists and psychologist around the country have been doing have reveal something really quite start ling something call the impact bias which the tendency for the simulator work bad for the simulator make you believe that different comes are more different than fact they really are from field studies laboratory studies see that winning losing election gain losing romantic partner getting not getting promotion pass not pass college test and have far less impact less intensity and much less ation than people expect them have fact recent study this almost floor recent study showing how major life trauma affect people suggest that happened over three months ago with only few exception has impact whatsoever your happiness why because happiness can synthesize sir thomas brown wrote the happiest man alive have that that can convert poverty rich adver prosperity more vulnerable than achilles fortune not one place hit what kind remarkable machinery does this guy have his head well turns out s precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off have human beings have something that might think psychological immune system system cognitive processes large non conscious cognitive processes that help them change their view the world that they can feel better about the world which they find themselves like sir thomas you have this machine unlike sir thomas you seem not know synthesize happiness but think happiness thing found now you don need give you too many examples people synthesizing happiness suspect though going show you some experimental evidence you don have look very far for evidence challenge myself since say this once while lecture took copy the new york times and tried find some instance people synthesizing happiness and here are three guys synthesizing happiness much better off physically financial emotionally mental and almost every other way don have one minute s regret was glorious experience believe turned out for the best who are these character who are damn happy well the first one jim wright some you are old enough remember was the chair the house represent ative and signed disgrace when this young republican named ging rich found out about shady book deal had done lost everything the most powerful democrat the country lost everything lost his money lost his power what does have say all these years later about much better off physically financial mental and almost every other way what other way would there better off ably mineral animal s pretty much covered them there more bickham somebody you never heard more bickham uttered these words upon being released was years old spent years louis state penitentiary for crime didn commit was ultimately rated the age through dna evidence and what did have say about his experience don have one minute s regret was glorious experience glorious this guy not saying well you know there were some nice guys they had gym s glorious word usually serve for something like religious experience harry s german uttered these words and s somebody you might have known but didn because read little article the paper about hamburger stand owned these two brother named mcdonald and thought that s really neat idea went find them they said can give you franchise this for bucks harry went back new york asked his brother who s investment bank loan him the dollars and his brother s immortal words were you idiot nobody eat hamburger wouldn lend him the money and course six months later ray croc had exactly the same idea turns out people eat hamburger and ray croc for while became the richest man america and then finally you know the best all possible world some you recognize this young photo pete best who was the original drummer for the beatles until they you know sent him out and snuck away and picked ring tour well when pete best was interview yes s still drummer yes s studio musician had this say happier than would have been with the beatles okay there s something important learned from these people and the secret happiness here finally reveal first accrue wealth power and prestige then lose second spend much your life prison you possibly can third make somebody else really really rich and finally never ever join the beatles now like frank can predict your next thought which yeah right because when people synthesize happiness these gentlemen seem have done all smile them but kind roll our eyes and say yeah right you never really wanted the job yeah right you really didn have that much common with her and you figured that out just about the time she threw the engage ment ring your face smirk because believe that synthetic happiness not the same quality what might call natural happiness what are these terms natural happiness what get when get what wanted and synthetic happiness what make when don get what wanted and our society have strong belief that synthetic happiness ferior kind why have that belief well s very simple what kind economic engine believed that not getting what want could make just happy getting with all logies friend matthieu card shopping full zen monks not going particularly profitable because they don want stuff enough want suggest you that synthetic happiness every bit real and during the kind happiness you tumble upon when you get exactly what you were aim for now scientist going this not with rhetoric but marinat you little bit data let first show you experimental paradigm that used demonstrate the synthesis happiness among regular old folks and this isn mine this year old paradigm called the free choice paradigm s very simple you bring say six objects and you ask subject rank them from the most the least liked this case because the experiment going tell you about uses them these are monet prints everybody can rank these monet prints from the one they like the most the one they like the least now give you choice happen have some extra prints the close going give you one your prize take home happen have number three and number four tell the subject this bit difficult choice because neither one preferred strongly the other but natural people tend pick number three because they liked little better than number four some time later could minutes could days the same stimul are put before the subject and the subject asked rank the stimul tell how much you like them now what happens watch happiness synthesize this the result that has been replicate over and over again you watching happiness synthesize would you like see again happiness the one got really better than thought that other one didn get suck that s the synthesis happiness now what s the right response that yeah right now here s the experiment did and would hope this going convince you that yeah right was not the right response did this experiment with group patients who had antero grade amnesia these are hospital ized patients most them have korsak s syndrome polyneuritic psycho that they rank way too much and they can make new memories they remember their childhood but you walk and introduce yourself and then leave the room when you come back they don know who you are took our monet prints the hospital and asked these patients rank them from the one they liked the most the one they liked the least then gave them the choice between number three and number four like everybody else they said gee thanks doc that s great could use new print take number three explained would have number three mail them gather our materials and went out the room and count half hour back into the room say back the patients bless them say doc sorry got memory problem that s why here met you before don remember really jim you don remember was just here with the monet prints sorry doc just don have clue problem jim all want you rank these for from the one you like the most the one you like the least what they well let s first check and make sure they really amnesiac ask these amnesiac patients tell which one they own which one they chose last time which one their and what find amnesiac patients just guess these are normal control where did this with you all you would know which print you chose but this with amnesiac patients they don have clue they can pick their print out line here s what normal control they synthesize happiness right this the change king score the change from the first time they rank the second time they rank normal control show that was the magic showed you now showing you graphic form the one own better than thought the one didn own the one left behind not good thought amnesiac exactly the same thing think about this result these people like better the one they own but they don know they own yeah right not the right response what these people did when they synthesize happiness they really truly changed their affect aesthetic reaction that poster they not just saying because they own because they don know they own now when psychologist show you bars you know that they are showing you average lots people and yet all have this psychological immune system this capacity synthesize happiness but some this trick better than others and some situation allow anybody more effectively than other situation turns out that freedom the ability make your mind and change your mind the friend natural happiness because allows you choose among all those ious future and find the one that you would most enjoy but freedom choose change and make your mind the enemy synthetic happiness and going show you why bert already know course you reading the cartoon talking bert s tech support how may abuse you printer prints blank page after every document why would you complain about getting free paper free aren you just giving own paper egad man look the quality the free paper compared your lousy regular paper only fool liar would say that they look the same now that you mention does seem little silk what are you doing helping people accept the things they cannot change indeed the psychological immune system works best when are totally stuck when are trapped this the difference between dating and marriage right mean you out date with guy and pick his nose you don out another date you married guy and pick his nose yeah has heart gold don touch the fruit cake right you find way happy with what s happened now what want show you that people don know this about themselves and not know this can work our supreme advantage here s experiment did harvard created photography course black and white photography course and allowed students come and learn how use dark room gave them camera they went around camp they took pictures their favorite professors and their dorm room and their dog and all the other things they wanted have harvard memories they bring the camera make contact sheet they figure out which are the two best pictures and now spend six hours teaching them about dark room and they blow two them and they have two gorgeous eight glossies meaningful things them and say which one would you like give they say have give one yes need one evidence the class project you have give one you have make choice you get keep one and get keep one now there are two conditions this experiment one case the students are told but you know you want change your mind always have the other one here and the next four days before actually mail head quarter glad yeah head quarter glad swap out with you fact come your dorm room and give just give email better yet check with you you ever want change your mind s totally return able the other half the students are told exactly the opposite make your choice and the way the mail going out gosh two minutes england your picture will wing way over the atlantic you will never see again now half the students each these conditions are asked make prediction about how much they going come like the picture that they keep and the picture they leave behind other students are just sent back their little dorm room and they are measured over the next three six days their king satisfaction with the pictures and look what find first all here s what students think going happen they think they going maybe come like the picture they chose little more than the one they left behind but these are not statistical significant difference s very small increase and doesn much matter whether they were the reversible reversible condition wrong bad simulator because here s what s really happening both right before the swap and five days later people who are stuck with that picture who have choice who can never change their mind like lot and people who are liberating should return have gotten the right one maybe this isn the good one maybe left the good one have killed themselves they don like their picture and fact even after the opportunity swap has expired they still don like their picture why because the reversible condition not conducive the synthesis happiness here s the final piece this experiment bring whole new group naive harvard students and say you know doing photography course and can one two ways could that when you take the two pictures you have four days change your mind doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make your mind right away and you can never change which course would you like duh percent the students two third prefer the course where they have the opportunity change their mind hello percent the students choose the course which they will ultimately deeply satisfied with the picture because they not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness grow the bar said everything best course and s making point here but s making hyper bolic ally nothing good bad but thinking makes s nice poetry but that can exactly right there really nothing good bad really the case that bladder surgery and trip paris are just the same thing that seems like one question test they can exactly the same more turgid but closer the truth was the father modern capital smith and said this this worth contemplat the great source both the and disorder human life seems arise from over rating the difference between one permanent situation and another some these situation may doubt deserve preferred others but none them can deserve pursue with that passionate which drive violate the rules either prudence justice corrupt the future tranquility our minds either shame from the remembrance our own fol remorse for the horror our own justice other words yes some things are better than others should have reference that lead into one future over another but when those reference drive too hard and too fast because have over rated the difference between these future when our ambition bounded leads work joyful when our ambition bounded leads lie steal hurt others sacrifice things real value when our fear are bounded prudent caut ious thought when our fear are bounded and over blown less and ward the lesson want leave you with from these data that our long and our worries are both some degree over blown because have within the capacity manufacture the very commodity are constantly chasing when choose experience thank you
