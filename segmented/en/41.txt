nicholas negroponte found the mit media laboratory describe how the one laptop per child project will build and distribute the laptop one laptop per child children design education entrepreneur global issues philanthropy social change technology nicholas negroponte one laptop per child been mit for years went ted there s only one other person here think who did that all the other ted and went them all under rick s regime talked about what the media lab was doing which today has almost people and you read the press actually last week said the media lab didn the media lab step down chair which was kind ridiculous title but someone else has taken and one the things you can professor you stay professor and will now for the rest life the one laptop per child which sort been doing for year and half anyway going tell you about this use minutes tell you why doing how doing and then what doing and some point even pass around what the laptop might like now was asked chris talk about some the big issues and figured start with the three that least drove this and the first pretty obvious s amazing when you meet head state and you say what your most precious natural resource they will not say children first and then when you say children they will pretty quickly agree with you and that isn very hard everybody agree that whatever the solutions are the big problems they include education sometimes can just education and can never without some element education that s certainly part and the third little bit less obvious and that that all this room learned how walk how talk not being taught how talk taught how walk but interacting with the world having certain results consequence being able ask for something being able stand and reach where about the age six were told stop learning that way and that all learning from then would happen through teaching whether s people standing like doing now book something but was really through teaching and one the things general that computers have provide learning that now include kind learning which little bit more like walking and talking the sense that lot s driven the learn himself herself with those the principles some you may know seymour paper this back when were working senegal because some people think that the laptop just happened year ago two years ago were struck lightning this actually has gone back long time and fact back the s here the s steve jobs had given some laptop were senegal didn scale but least was bringing computers developing countries and learning pretty quickly that these kids even though english wasn their language the latin alpha barely was their language but they could just swim like fish they could play these like piano little bit more recently got involved personally and these are two anecdotes one was cambodia village that has electricity water television telephone but has broad band internet now and these kids their first english word google and they only know skype they never heard telephony they just use skype and they home night they got broad band connection hut that doesn have electricity the parents love because when they open the laptop s the bright light source the house and talk about where metaphor and reality mix this the actual school parallel with this seymour paper got the governor main legisl one laptop per child the year now the time think s fair say that percent the teachers were let say apprehensive really they were actually against and they really preferred that the money would used for higher aries more school whatever and now three and half years later guess what they report five things drop truancy almost zero tend parent teacher meeting which nobody did and now almost everybody does drop discipline problems increase student participation teachers are now saying s kind fun teach kids are engage they have laptop and then the fifth which interest the most that the servers have turned off certain times night because the teachers are just getting too much email from the kids asking them for help when you see that kind thing this not something that you have test the days pilot projects are over when people say well like three four thousand our country see how works screw you the back the line and someone else will and then when you figure out that this works you can join well and this what doing one laptop per child was formed about year and half ago s nonprofit association raised about million dollars the engineering just get this built and then have produced afterwards scale truly important and s not important because you can buy components lower price s because you can manufacture and will leave the name out but wanted small display doesn have have perfect color uniform can even have pixel two missing doesn have that bright and this particular manufacture said well you know not interested that interested the living room interested perfect color uniform interested big display bright display you not part our strategic plan and said well that s kind too bad because need million units year and they said well maybe could become part your strategic plan and that s why scale count and that s why will not launch this without five million units the first run and the idea launch with enough scale that the scale itself help bring the price down and that s why said seven million there and doing without sales and marketing team mean you looking the sales and marketing team will going seven large countries and getting them agree and launch and then the others can follow have partners s not hard guess google would one the others are all playing ending and this has been the press great deal s the called green machine that introduced with kofi anna november the world that was held tunis now once people start looking this they say this laptop project well s not laptop project s education project and the fun part and quite focused tell people used light bulb but now laser just going get that thing built and turns out s not hard because laptop economics are the following say percent here s more like percent the cost your laptop sales marketing distribution and profit now have none those none those figure into our cost because first all sell cost and the government distribute gets distribute the school system like textbook that piece disappear and then you have display and everything else now the display your laptop cost rough number dollars diagonal inch now that can drop eight can drop seven but s not going drop two one and half unless some pretty clever things s the rest that little brown box that pretty fascinating because the rest your laptop devoted itself s little bit like obese person having use most their energy move their obesity and have situation today which incredible been using laptop since their inception and laptop runs slow less ably and less pleasant than ever has before and this year worse now people sometimes you even get standing ovation and say what the hell s wrong with you why are all sitting there and somebody remain name less called our laptop gadget recently and said god our laptop s going like bat out hell when you open s going bing use just like was when you bought apple macintosh worked really well and been going steadi down hill now this people ask all the time what that s what the two pieces that are probably able mesh network when the kids open their laptop they all become network and then just need one two point back haul you can serve couple thousand kids with two mega you really can bring into village and then the village can connect themselves and you really can quite well the dual mode display the idea have display that both works outdoors isn fun using your cell phone outdoors the sunlight well you can see and one the reasons you can see because s back light most the time most cell phones now what doing doing one that will both front and back and whether you manual switch you the software seen but when s back s color and when s front s black and white three times the solution all worked out that s why lot our people are more less living taiwan right now and about days know for sure whether this works probably the most important piece there that the kids really can the maintenance and this again something that people don believe but really think s quite true that s the machine showed tunis this more the direction that going and s something that didn think was possible now going pass this around this isn design this just mechanical engineering sort embodi ment for you play with and s clearly just model the working one mit going pass this hand some gentleman least you can then decide whether goes left simul cast sorry wherever the camera good point thank you chris the idea was that would not only laptop but that could transform and into electronic book s sort electronic book this where when you outside s black and white the games button are missing but also games machine book machine set this way and s television set etc etc that enough for simul cast sorry let jim decide which way send afterwards seven countries say maybe for massachusetts because they actually have bid law you got bid and and forth can quite name them the other case they don have bid they can decide s the federal government each case s kind izing because lot people say well let s the state level because course states are more nimble than the fed just because size and yet count really dealing with the federal government really dealing with ministries education and you look government around the world ministries education tend the most conserv ative and also the ones that have huge roll everybody think they know about education lot culture built into well s really hard and s certainly the hard road you look the countries they pretty cultural distribute have they all agreed not completely probably thai land brazil and nigeria are the three that are the most active and most agreed purpose not sign anything with anybody until actually have the working ones and since visit each one those countries within least every three months just going around the world every three weeks here s sort the schedule and put the bottom might give some away free two years this meeting everybody says s laptop you can well guess what not coming probably start then drift down and that s very important because many things hit the market price and then drift s kind the loss leader and then soon looks interesting can afford can scale out target dollars the gray market s big issue and one the ways just one but one the ways help the case the gray market make something that utterly unique s little bit like the fact that automobiles thousands automobiles are stolen every day the united states not one single post office truck stolen and why because there s market for post office trucks looks like post office truck you can spray paint you can anything you want just learned recently south africa white volv are stolen period none zero want make very much like white volv each government has task force this perhaps less interesting but trying get the government all work together and s not easy the economics this start with the federal government and then later other whether s child child funding child this country buy one for child the developing world maybe the same gender maybe the same age uncle gives niece phew that birthday present mean there are all sorts things that will happen and they very very exciting and everybody says say s education project are providing the software the answer the system certainly has software but not providing the education content that really done the countries but are certainly construction and certainly believe learning doing and everything from logo which was started more modern things like scratch you ever even heard are very very much part and that s the roll are dreaming this real actually real the only criticism and people really don want criticize this because humanitarian effort nonprofit effort and criticize little bit stupid actually but the one thing that people could criticize was great idea but these guys can and that could either mean these guys professors and couldn that s not possible well december company called quant agreed build and since they make about one third all the laptop the planet today that question disappeared s not matter whether s going happen going happen and comes out dollars what comes out six months late what that s pretty soft land thank you
