author steven johnson takes minute tour the ghost map his book about cholera outbreak london and the impact had science cities and modern society cities culture design epidemiology health history map science urban planning steven johnson tour the ghost map you haven order yet generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce goes best with diseases the small sorry just feel like should doing stand here because the setting what want take you back london for the next few minutes and tell the story brief this outbreak which many ways think helped create the world that live today and particularly the kind city that live today this period the middle part the century london s history incredibly interesting for number reasons but think the most important one that london was this city million people and was the largest city the face the planet that point but was also the largest city that had ever been built and the victorians were trying live through and simultaneously invent whole new scale living this scale living that you know now call metropolitan living and was many ways this point the mid s complete disaster they were basically city living with modern kind industrial metropol with elizabeth public infrastructure people for instance just gross you out for second had cesspool human waste their base ment like foot two feet deep and they would just kind throw the buckets down there and hope that would somehow away and course never really would away and all this stuff basically had accumulate the point where the city was incredibly offensive just walk around was amazing smell city not just because the cesspool but also the number live stock the city would shock people not just the horse but people had cows their attic that they would use for milk that they would hoist there and keep them the attic until literally their milk ran out and they died and then they would drag them off the bone boil down the street you would just walk around london this point and just overwhelm with this stench and what ended happening that entire emerging public health system became convinced that was the smell that was killing everybody that was creating these diseases that would wipe through the city every three four years and cholera was really the great killer this period arrived london and every four five years another epidemic would take people london and throughout the and the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem had get rid the smell and fact they concoct couple early you know found public health intervention the system the city one which was called the nuisances act which they got everybody far they could empty out their cesspool and just pour all that waste into the river because get out the streets smell much better and right drink from the river what ended happening actually they ended increasing the outbreak cholera because now know cholera actually the water s water borne disease not something that s the air s not something you smell hale s something you ing and one the found moment public health the century effectively poison the water supply london much more effectively than any modern day terrorist could have ever dream doing this was the state london and the middle all this and offensive conditions and the midst all this scientific fusion about what was actually killing people was very talent classic century multi discipl arian named john who was local doctor soho london who had been arguing for about four five years that cholera was fact water borne disease and had basically convinced nobody this the public health authorities had large ignored what had say and made the case number paper and done number studies but nothing had really stuck and part what s interesting about this story that some ways s great case study how cultural change happens how good idea eventually comes win out over much worse ideas and labor for long time with this great sight that everybody ignored and then one day august young child five month old girl whose first name don know know her only baby lewis somehow contract cholera came down with cholera broad street you can really see this map but this the map that becomes the central focus the second half book s the middle soho this working class neighborhood this little girl becomes sick and turns out that the cesspool that they still continue have despite the nuisances act border extremely popular water pump local water hole that was well known for the best water all soho that all the residents from soho and the surround neighborhood would and this little girl adver tent ended contaminat the water this popular pump and one the most terrifying outbreak the history england erupt about two three days later literally percent the neighborhood died seven days and much more would have died people hadn after the initial outbreak kick was this incredibly terrifying even you had these scene entire families dying over the course hours cholera alone their one room apartment their little flat just extraordinary terrifying scene lived near there heard about the outbreak and this amazing act courage went directly into the belly the beast because thought outbreak that concentrate could actually potential end convincing people that fact the real mena cholera was the water supply and not the air suspect outbreak that concentrate would probably involve single point source one single thing that everybody was going because didn have the traditional slow path infection that you might expect and went right there and started interview people eventually list the help this amazing other figure who s kind the other protagonist the book this guy henry white head who was local minister who was not all man science but was incredibly socially connected knew everybody the neighborhood and managed track down white head did many the case people who had drunk water from the pump who hadn drunk water from the pump and eventually made map the outbreak found increasing that people who rank from the pump were getting sick people who hadn drunk from the pump were not getting sick and thought about represent that kind table statistics people living different neighborhood people who hadn you know percentage people who hadn but eventually hit upon the idea that what needed was something that you could see something that would take sense higher level view all this activity that had been happening the neighborhood and created this map which basically ended represent all the deaths the neighborhood black bars each address and you can see this map the pump right the center and you can see that one the residences down the way had about people dead and the map actually little bit bigger you get further and further away from the pump the deaths begin grow less and less frequent and you can see this something poison ating out this pump that you could see glance and with the help this map and with the help more evange that did over the next few years and that white head did eventually actually the authorities slowly started come around took much longer than sometimes like think this story but when the next big cholera outbreak came london the authorities had been convinced part because this story part because this map that fact the water was the problem and they had already started building the sewers london and they immediately went this outbreak and they told everybody start boil their water and that was the last time that london has seen cholera outbreak since part this story think well s terrifying story s very dark story and s story that continue many the developing cities the world s also story really that fundamentally optimist which say that s possible solve these problems listen reason listen the kind wisdom these kinds map listen people like and white head listen the local who understand what s going these kinds situation and what ended doing making the idea large scale metropolitan living sustainable one when people were looking percent their neighborhood dying the space seven days there was wide spread consensus that this couldn that people weren meant live cities million people but because what did because this map because the whole series forms that happened the wake this map now take for grant that cities have million people cities like this one are fact sustainable things don worry that new york city going collapse itself quite the way that you know did and percent size years years and that way the ultimate legacy this map s map deaths that ended creating whole new way life the life that enjoy here today thank you very much
