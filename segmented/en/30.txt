steven levitt shares data that shows car seats are more effective than seatbelts protect kids from dying cars however during the question and answer session makes one crucial cave business cars culture economics parenting statistics transportation steven levitt child seats once upon time there was read disease that afflic children and fact among all the diseases that existed this land was the worst killed the most children and along came brilliant inventor scientist who came with partial cure for that disease and wasn perfect many children still died but was certainly better than what they had before and one the good things about this cure was that was free virtually free and was very easy use but the worst thing about was that you couldn use the young children infant and one year olds and consequence few years later another scientist perhaps maybe this scientist not quite brilliant the one who had precede him but building the invention the first one came with second cure and the beauty the second cure for this disease was that could used infant and one year olds and the problem with this cure was was very expensive and was very complicated use and although parents tried hard they could use properly almost all them ended using wrong the end but what they did course since was complicated and expensive they only used the zero year olds and the one year olds and they kept using the existing cure that they had the two year olds and and this went for quite some time people were happy they had their two cures until particular mother whose child had just turned two died this disease and she thought herself child just turned two and until the child turned two had always used this complicated expensive cure you know this treatment and then the child turned two and started using the cheap and easy treatment and wonder and she wonder like all parents who lose children wonder there isn something that could have done like keep using that complicated expensive cure and she told all the other people and she said how could possibly that something that s cheap and simple works well something that s complicated and expensive and the people thought you know you right probably the wrong thing switch and use the cheap and simple solution and the government they heard her story and the other people and they said yeah you right should make law should this cheap and simple treatment and not let anybody use this their children and the people were happy they were satisfied for many years this went along and everything was fine but then along came low economist who had children himself and used the expensive and complicated treatment but knew about the cheap and simple one and thought about and the expensive one didn seem that great him thought don know anything about science but know something about data maybe should and look the data and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment actually works any better than the cheap and simple one and and hold when went through the data found that didn look like the expensive complicated solution was any better than the cheap one least for the children who were two and older the cheap one still didn work the kids who were younger and went forth the people and said made this wonderful finding looks could just use the cheap and simple solution and doing could save ourselves million dollars year and could spend that our children other ways and the parents were very happy and they said this terrible thing because how can the cheap and easy thing good the hard thing and the government was very upset and particular the people who made this expensive solution were very upset because they thought how can hope compete with something that s essentially free would lose all our market and people were very angry and they called him horrible name and decided that maybe should leave the country for few days and seek out some more intelligent open mind people place called oxford and come and try and tell the story that place and anyway here s not fair tale s true story about the united states today and the disease refer ring actually motor vehicle accident for children and the free cure adult seatbelts and the expensive cure the million dollar year cure child car seats and what like talk you about today some the evidence why believe this true that for children two years old and there really real benefit prove benefit car seats spite the incredible energy that has been devoted toward expand the laws and making socially unacceptable put your children into seatbelts and then talk about why what that makes that true and then finally talk little bit about third way about another technology which probably better than anything have but which there hasn been any enthusiasm for adoption precisely because people are enamored with the current car seat solution many times when you try research data records complicated stories s hard find the data doesn turn out the case when you look seatbelts versus car seats the united states keep data set every fatal accident that s happened since every car crash which least one person die they have information all the people you look that data s right the national highway transportation safety administration s website you can just look the raw data and begin get sense the limited amount evidence that s favor car seats for children age two and here the data here have among two six year olds anyone above six basically one uses car seats you can compare percent the children who are unrestrained crash which least one person die themselves die you put child car seat percent the children die they wear lap and shoulder belt this raw data percent die and interesting wear lap only seatbelt percent die and actually the theory tells you that the lap only seatbelt s got worse than the lap and shoulder belt and that just minds you that when you deal with raw data there are hundreds found variable that may getting the way what the study and this just present the same information but turned into figure make easier the yellow bar represent car seats the orange bar lap and shoulder and the red bar lap only seatbelts and this all relative unrestrained the bigger the bar the better okay this the data just showed the highest bar what you striving beat you can control for the basic things like how hard the crash was what seat the child was sitting etc the age the child and that s that middle set bars and you can see that the lap only seatbelts start look worse once you that and then finally the last set bars which are really controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash different characteristic the crash and what you find that the car seats and the lap and shoulder belt when comes saving lives fatal ities look exactly identical and the standard error band are relatively small around these estimate well and s not just over s very robust anything you want look one thing that s interesting you look frontal impact crashes when the car crashes the front hits into something indeed what you see that the car seats look little bit better and think this isn just chance order have the car seat approved you need pass certain federal standards all which involve slam your car into direct frontal crash but when you look other types crashes like rear impact crashes indeed the car seats don perform well and think that s because they been optimize pass always expect people optimize relative bright line rules about how affected the car will and the other thing you might argue well car seats have got lot better over time and look recent crashes the whole data set almost years worth data you won see the recent crashes the new car seats are far far better but indeed recent crashes the lap and shoulder seatbelts actually are doing even better than the car seats they say well that s impossible that can and the line argument you ask parents but car seats are expensive and complicated and they have this big angle latches how could they possibly not work better than seatbelts because they are expensive and complicated s kind interesting logic think that people use and the other logic they say well the government wouldn have told use them they weren much better but what s interesting the government telling use them not actually based very much really based some impassioned plea parents whose children died after they turned two which has led the passage all these laws not very much data you can only get far think telling your story using these abstract statistics and had some friends over dinner and was asking had cook was asking them what advice they might have for about point they said why don you run some crash test and said that s great idea actually tried commission some crash test and turns out that called around the independent crash test companies around the country none them wanted our crash test because they said some explicit some not explicit all our business comes from car seat manufacturers can risk alien ating them testing seatbelts relative car seats now eventually one did under the conditions anonymity they said they would happy this test for anonymity and dollars per seat that crash and went buffalo new york and here the precursor these are the crash test dummies waiting for their chance take the center stage and then here s how the crash test works here they don actually crash the entire car you know s not worth ruin whole car they just have these bench seats and they trap the car seat and the seatbelt just wanted you look this and think this gives you good idea why parents think car seats are great look the kid the car seat does not look content ready like could survive anything and then you look the kid back looks like s already king before the crash even happens s hard believe when you look this that that kid back going very well when you get crash this going crash where they going slam this thing forward into wall miles hour and see what happens let show you what happens these are three year old dummies the way here this the car seat now watch two things watch how the head goes forward and basically hits the knee and this the car seat and watch how the car seat flies around the bound the air the car seat s moving all over the place bear mind there are two things about this this car seat that was install someone who has install car seats who knew exactly how and also turned out these bench seats are the very best way install car seats having flat back makes much easier install them and this test that s very much favor the car seat that kid this crash far very well the federal standards are that you have score below approved car seat this crash some metric units which are not important and this crash would have been about this car seat was actually above average car seat from consumer report and did quite well the next one now this the kid same crash who the seatbelt hardly move all actually relative the other child the funny thing the cam work terrible because they only set the car seats and they actually don even have way move the camera you can see the kid that s the bound anyway turns out that those two crashes that actually the three year old did light worse gets about out you know this range relative and something but still you just took that data from that crash the federal government and said have invented new car seat would like you prove for selling then they would say this fantastic new car seat works great only got could have gotten high and this seatbelt would have passed with flying color into being approved car seat some sense what this suggest that s not just that people are setting their car seats wrong which putting children risk s just that fundamentally the car seats aren doing much here s the crash these are time the same time you can see that takes much longer with the car seat bound takes lot longer but there s just lot less movement for child who s the seatbelt show you the six year old crashes well the six year old car seat and turns out that looks terrible but that s great that s like that kid would fine the crash nothing about that would have been problem atic the child all and then here s the six year old the seatbelt and fact they get exactly within you know within one two point the same really for the six year old the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever that s some more evidence some sense was criticize scientist who said you could never publish study with meaning those four crashes wrote him back and said what about because had the other other real world crashes and just think that s interesting that the idea using real world crashes which very much something that economists think would the right thing something that scientists don actually usually think they would rather use laboratory very imperfect science looking the dummies than actually years data what seen with children and with car seats and think the answer this puzzle that there s much better solution out there that s gotten nobody excited because everyone light with the way car seats are presumably working and you think from design perspective about going back square one and say just want protect kids the back seat don there s anyone this room who say well the right way start would let s make great seat belt for adults and then let s make this really big contrapti that you have rig this daisy chain mean why not start who s sitting the back seat anyway except for kids but essentially something like this which don know exactly how much would cost but there s reason could see why this should much more expensive than regular car seat s just actually you see this fold s behind the seat you got regular seat for adults and then you fold down and the kid top and s integrated seems that this can very expensive solution and s got work better than what already have the question there any hope for adoption something like this which would presumably save lot lives and think the answer perhaps lies story the answer both why has car seat been successful and why this may some adopted not lies story that dad told ating when was doctor the s air force england and this long time ago you were allowed things then you can today father would have patients come who thought were not really sick and had big jar full placebo pills that would give them and say come back week you still feel lousy and most them would not come back but some them would come back and when they came back still convinced they were not sick had another jar pills this jar were huge horse pills they were almost impossible swallow and these are the analog for the car seats people would look these and say man this thing big and hard swallow this doesn make feel better you know what possibly could and turned out that most people wouldn come back because worked but every once while there was still patient convinced that was sick and come back and dad had third jar pills and the jar pills had said were the tiniest little pills could find small you could barely see them and would say listen know gave you that huge pill that complicated hard swallow pill before but now got one that s potent that really tiny and small and almost invisible s almost like this thing here which you can even see and turned out that never all the times dad gave out this pill the really tiny pill did anyone ever come back still complain sick ness dad always took that evidence that this little teeny powerful pill had the ultimate placebo effect and some sense that s the right story think integrated car seats you will see very quickly becoming something that everyone has the other possible conclusion well maybe after coming father three times getting sent home with placebo still felt sick went and found another doctor and that s completely possible and that s the case then think stuck with conventional car seats for long time come thank you very much audience just wanted ask you when wear seatbelts don necessarily wear them just prevent loss life s also prevent lots serious injury your data looks fatal ities doesn look serious injury there any data show that child seats are actually less effective just effective seatbelts for serious injury because that would prove your case steven levitt yeah that s great question data and another data set looked for new jersey crashes find very small difference injury this data s statistical significant difference injury between car seats and lap and shoulder belt the new jersey data which different because s not just fatal crashes but all crashes new jersey that are reported turns out that there percent difference injuries but generally they the minor injuries now what s interesting should say this disclaimer there medical literature that very difficult solve with this other data which suggest that car seats are dramatically better and they use completely different method ology that involve after the crash occur they get from the insurance companies the name the people who were the crash and they call them the phone and they asked them what happened and really can solve yet and like work with these medical research try understand how there can these difference which are completely odds with one another but s obviously critical question the question even are there enough serious injuries make these cost effective s kind tricky even they right s not clear that they cost effective
