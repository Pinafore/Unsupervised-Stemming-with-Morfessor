child let that happen that s investigation the negative imagination when started this project called the road search for american character with tape record thought that was going around america and find all aspect bull rider boys pig farmers drum major ettes but sort got trip race relations because first big show was show about race riot and went both two race riot one which was the los angeles riot and this next piece from that because this what would say learned the most about race relations from this piece s kind aria would say and many tape that have everybody know that the los angeles riot happened because four cops beat black man named rodney king was capture video tape technology and was play all over the world everybody thought the four cops would jail they did not there were riot and what lot people there was second trial order george bush and that trial came back with two cops going jail and two cops declar innocent was that trial and mean the people just dance the streets because they were afraid there was going another riot explosion joy that this verdict had come back this way there was community that didn the korean americans whose store had been burn the ground and this woman young soon han suppose will have taught the most that have learned about race and she asks also question that studs talk about this notion the official truth question the official truth what she s question here she s taking chance and question what justice society and this called swallow the bitterness used believe america was the best watched korea many ious hollywood lifestyle movie never saw any poor man any black until used believe america was the best still don deny that because victim but the end when were such turmoil and having all the financial problems and all the mental problems began really realize that korean are completely left out this society and are nothing why why have left out didn qualify for medical treatment food stamp anything many african americans who never work got minimum amount money survive didn get any because have car and house and are high taxpayer where find justice many african americans probably think that they won the trial was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict and all the day they were having party they celebrate all south central all the church and they say well finally justice has been done this society well what about victims rights they got their rights destroying innocent korean merchants they have lot respect for martin king the only model for black community don care jesse jackson the model non violence non violence and they would all like his spirit but what about they destroyed innocent people and wonder that really justice for them get their rights that way was swallow the bitterness sitting here alone and watching them they became hilarious but was happy for them was glad for them least they got something back let s just about korean victims and other victims who were destroyed them they fought for their rights for over two centuries and maybe because they sacrifice other minor ities hispanic asian would suffer more the mainstream that s why understand that s why have mix feeling about the verdict but wish that wish that wish that could part the enjoy ment wish that could live together with black people but after the riot s too much difference the fire still there how you say unclear igniting igniting igniting fire igniting fire s still there can burst out time young soon han the other reason that don wear shoes just case really feel like have cuddle and get into the feet somebody walking really somebody else s shoes and told you that you know didn give you the year but thought that was going around and find bull rider and pig farmers and people like that and got side track race relations finally did find bull rider two years ago and been going the rodeo with him and bond and s the lead ed did about the republican convention s republican won say anything about party affiliation but anyway this dear dear rent william and this toughness case anybody needs know about being tough for the work that you think there s real lesson this and this
