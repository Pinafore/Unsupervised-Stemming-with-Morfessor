journalist carl honor believe the western world s emphasis speed erodes health productivity and quality life but there s back lash brew everyday people start putting the brakes their all too modern lives choice culture happiness health parenting personal growth potential psychology carl honor praises slowness what like start off with observation which that learned anything over the last year s that the supreme irony publishing book about slowness that you have around promoting really fast seem spend most time these days zipping from city city studio studio interview interview serving the book really tiny bite size chunk because everyone these days want know how slow down but they want know how slow down really quickly did spot cnn the other day where actually spent more time make than did talking air and think that that s not really surprising though because that s kind the world that live now world stuck fast forward world obsessed with speed with doing everything faster with cram more and more into less and less time every moment the day feel like race against the clock borrow phrase from carrie fisher which bio there just out again these days even instant gratification takes too long and you think about how try make things better what speed them don used dial now speed dial used read now speed read used walk now speed walk and course used date and now speed date and even things that are their very nature slow try and speed them too was new york recently and walked past gym that had advertise ment the window for new course new evening course and was for you guess speed this the perfect solution for time starved professionals who want you know the sun but only want give over about minutes mean these are sort the extreme examples and they using and good laugh but there s very serious point and think that the head long daily life often lose sight the damage that this roadrunner form living does marinat the culture speed that almost fail notice the takes every aspect our lives our health our diet our work our relationship the environment and our community and sometimes takes wake call doesn alert the fact that hurry through our lives instead actually living them that living the fast life instead the good life and think for many people that wake call takes the form illness you know burn eventually the body says can take anymore and throw the towel maybe relationship goes smoke because haven had the time the patience the tranquility with the other person listen them and wake call came when started reading bedtime stories and found that the end day would into his room and just couldn slow down you know speed reading the cat the hat you know skip ping lines here graph there sometimes whole page and course little boy knew the book inside out would quarrel and what should have been the most the most intimate the most tend moment the day when dad down read his became instead this kind glad iatorial battle will clash between speed and this went for some time until caught myself scanning newspaper article with time saving tip for fast people and one them made reference series books called the one minute bedtime story and wince saying those words now but first reaction the time was very different first reflex was say hallelujah what great idea this exactly what looking for speed bedtime even more but thank fully light bulb went over head and next reaction was very different and took step back and thought you know has really come this really such hurry that prepared fob off with sound the end the day and put away the newspaper and was getting plane and there and did something hadn done for long time which did nothing just thought and thought long and hard and the time got off that plane decided wanted something about wanted investigate this whole roadrunner culture and what was doing and everyone else and had two questions head the first was how did get fast and the second possible even desirable slow down now you think about how our world got accele rated the usual suspect rear their head you think you know urban ization consumer the work place technology but think you cut through those forces you get what might the deeper driver the nub the question which how think about time itself other culture time cyclical s seen moving great unhurried circle s always and fresh itself where the west time linear s finite resource s always rain away you either use lose time money benjamin franklin said and think what that does psychological create equation time scarce what well well speed don try and more and more with less and less time turn every moment every day into race the finish line finish line incident ally that never reach but finish line nonetheless and guess that the question possible break free from that mind and thank fully the answer yes because what discovered when began looking around that there global back lash against this culture that tells that faster always better and that best right across the world people are doing the unthinkable they slowing down and finding that although conventional wisdom tells you that you slow down you road kill the opposite turns out true that slowing down the right moment people find that they everything better they eat better they make love better they exercise better they work better they live better and this kind cauldr moment and places and acts deceler ation lie what lot people now refer the international slow movement now you small act hypocrisy just give you very quick over view what s going inside the slow movement you think food many you will have heard the slow food movement started italy but has spread across the world and now has member countries and s driven very simple and sensible message which that get more pleasure and more health from our food when cult cook and consume reasonable pace think also the explosion the organic farming movement and the renaissance farmers market are other illustration the fact that people are desperate get away from eating and cooking and cult ivat their food industrial time table they want get back slow rhythm and out the slow food movement has grown something called the slow cities movement which has started italy but has spread right across europe and beyond and this towns begin think how they organize the urban landscape that people are encourage slow down and smell the rose and connect with one another they might traffic put park bench some green space and some ways these changes add more than the sum their parts because think when slow city becomes official slow city s kind like philosophical declar ation s saying the rest world and the people that town that believe that the century slowness has role play medicine think lot people are deeply illusion with the kind quick fix mental you find conventional medicine and millions them around the world are turning complementary and alternative forms medicine which tend tap into sort slow gentle more holistic forms healing now obviously the jury out many these complementary therapies and personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever you know gain mainstream oval such acupuncture and mass and even just relaxation clearly have some kind benefit and blue chip medical college everywhere are starting study these things find out how they work and what might learn from them sex there s awful lot fast sex around isn there was coming well pun intended there was making way let s say slowly oxford and went through news agent and saw magazine men s magazine and said the front how bring your partner orgasm seconds you know even sex stop watch these days now you know like quick much the next person but think that there s awful lot gain from slow sex from slowing down the bedroom you know you tap into that those deeper sort psychological emotional spiritual current and you get better orgasm with the build you can get more bang for your buck let s say mean the point sister said most eloquent didn they when they the praises love with slow hand now all laughed few years ago when went tantric but you fast forward few years and now you find couple all ages lock workshop maybe just their own their own bedroom finding ways put the brakes and have better sex and course italy where mean italian always seem know where find their pleasure they launched official slow sex movement the work place right across much the world north america being able exception working hours have been coming down and europe example that and people finding that their quality life improve they working less and also that their hour productivity goes now clearly there are problems with the hour work week france too much too soon too but other countries europe ably the nordic countries are showing that s possible have kick economy without being work aholic and sweden mark and land now rank among the top six most competitive nations earth and they work the kind hours that would make the average american weep with envy and you beyond sort the country level down the micro company level more and more companies now are realizing that they need allow their staff either work fewer hours just plug take lunch break quiet room switch off their black rrys and laptop you the back mobile phones during the work day the week that they have time charge and for the brain slide into that kind creative mode thought s not just though these days adults who over work though s children too and childhood ended the mid s and look kids now and just amazed the way they race around with more homework more tutor more extracurriculars than would ever have conceived generation ago and some the most hear trend emails that get website are actually from adoles cents over the edge burn leading with write their parents help them slow down help them get off this full throttle mill but thank fully there back lash there parenting well and you finding that you know towns the united states are now band together and ning extracurriculars particular day the month that people can you know compress and have some family time and slow down homework another thing there are homework ban spring all over the developed world school which had been pil the homework for years and now they discovering that less can more there was case scotl recently where fee paying high achieving private school for everyone under the age and the high achieving parents freak out and said what are you you know our kids will fall the head master said your children need slow down the end the day and just this last month the exam results came and math science mark went percent average last year and think what s very revealing that the elite universities who are often cited the reason that people drive their kids and house them much are starting notice the liber students coming them falling these kids have wonderful mark they have cvs with extracurriculars the point that would make your eyes water but they lack park they lack the ability think creative and think outside they don know how dream and what these ivy league school and oxford and cambridge and are starting send message parents and students that they need put the brakes little bit and harvard for instance they send out letter under graduate fresh telling them that they get more out life and more out harvard they put the brakes they less but give time things the time that things need enjoy them savor them and even they sometimes nothing all and that letter called very revealing think slow down with exclam ation mark the end wherever you look the message seems the same that less very often more that slow very often better but that said course s not that easy slow down mean you heard that got speed ticket while was research book the benefits slowness and that s true but that s not all was actually route dinner held slow food the time and that s not enough got that ticket italy and any you have ever driven italian highway you have pretty good idea how fast was going but why hard slow down think there are various reasons one that speed fun you know speed sexy s all that adrenaline rush s hard give think there s kind physical dimension that speed becomes way wall ourselves off from the bigger deeper questions fill our head with distraction with busyness that don have ask well happy are children growing right are politician making good decisions behalf another reason although think perhaps the most powerful reason why find hard slow down the cultural taboo that erec against slowing down slow dirty word our culture s word for lazy slacker for being somebody who gives you know s bit slow s actually synonymous with being stupid guess what the slow movement the purpose the slow movement main goal really tackle that taboo and say that yes sometimes slow not the answer that there such thing bad slow you know got stuck the which ring road around london recently and spent three and half hours there and can tell you that s really bad slow but the new idea the sort evolutionary idea the slow movement that there such thing good slow too and good slow you know taking the time eat meal with your family with the switch off taking the time look problem from all angle the office make the best decision work even simply just taking the time slow down and savor your life now one the things that found most lifting about all this stuff that s happened around the book since came out the reaction and knew that when book slowness came out would welcome the new age brigade but s also been taken with great the corporate world you know business press but also big companies and leadership organization because people the top the chain people like you think are starting realize that there s too much speed the system there s too much busyness and s time find get back that lost art shift ears another encouraging sign think that s not just the developed world that this idea s been taken the developing world countries that are the verge making that leap into first world status china brazil thai land and these countries have embrace the idea the slow movement many people them and there s debate going their media the streets because think they looking the west and they saying well like that aspect what you got but not sure about that all that said guess possible that s really the main question before today possible slow down and happy able say you that the answer sound yes and present myself exhibit kind formed and rehab ated speed aholic still love speed you know live london and work journalist and enjoy the buzz and the busyness and the adrenaline rush that comes from both those things play and ice hockey two very fast sports and wouldn give them for the world but also over the last year got touch with inner rtoise and what that means that longer over load myself gratuitous fault mode longer rush aholic longer hear time s wing chariot drawing near least not much did before can actually hear now because see time tick off and the shot all that that actually feel lot happier healthier more productive than ever have feel like living life rather than actually just racing through and perhaps the most important measure the success this that feel that relationship are lot deeper and for guess the litmus test for whether this would work and what would mean was always going bedtime stories because that s sort where the journey began and there too the news rosy you know the end the day into s room don wear watch switch off computer can hear the email ping into the basket and just slow down his pace and read and because children have their own tempo and internal clock they don quality time where you schedule minutes for them open you they need you move their rhythm find that minutes into story you know will suddenly say you know something happened the play ground today that really bothered and off and have conversation that and now find that bedtime stories used box list something that read because was slow and had get through quickly s become reward the end the day something really cherish and have kind hollywood ending talk this afternoon which goes little bit like this few months ago was getting ready another book tour and had bag pack was downstairs the front door and was waiting for taxi and came down the stair and made card for and was carrying gone and staple two cards very like these together and put stick his favorite character tintin the front and said handed this and read and said daddy love benjamin and thought that s really sweet that good luck the book tour card and said daddy this card for being the best story reader the world and thought yeah you know this slowing down thing really does work thank you very much
