showing series inspiring unusual and play products british brand and design guru paul bennett explain that design doesn have about grand gesture but can solve small universal and over looked problems arts business design industrial design product design paul bennett find design the details hello actually that s hello bauer bodoni for the typo graphic ally hyste rical among one the threads that seems have come through loud and clear the last couple days this need reconcile what the big want the big being the organization the system the country and what the small want the individual the person and how you bring those two things together charlie better yesterday thought talked very articulately about this need bring consumer bring people into the process creating things and that s what want talk about today bringing together the small help facilitate and create the big think something that believe something believe and something that kind bring life through what ideo call this first chapter for the brits the room the blind glimpse the bleeding obvious often the good ideas are star you right the face that you kind miss them and think lot times what just sort hold the mirror our clients and sort duh you know look what s really going and rather than talk about the theory think just going show you example were asked large healthcare system minnesota describe them what their patient experience was and think they were expecting they worked with lots consult ants before think they were expecting some kind hideous org chart with thousands bubble and system this that and the other and all kinds stuff even worse some kind ghastly death power point thing with chart and all kinds you know god know whatever the first thing actually shared with them was this play this until your ball completely dissolve this seconds into the film this minute think something happens think head may appear second showed them the whole cut and they were all completely what this and the point when you lie hospital bed all day all you look the roof and s really shit experience and just putting yourself the position the patient this christian who works with ideo just lay the hospital bed and kind star the polystyrene ceiling tiles for really long time that s what s like patient the hospital and they were sort you know blind glimpse bleeding obvious good ness looking the situation from the point view the person out opposed the traditional position the organization was for these guys quite revelation and that was really catalytic thing for them they snap into action they said s not about system change s not about huge ridiculous things that need s about tiny things that can make huge amount difference started with them prototyping some really little things that could have huge amount impact the first thing did was took little bicycle mirror and band aid here gurney hospital trolley that when you were wheel around nurse doctor you could actually have conversation with them you could kind see them your rear view mirror created tiny human interaction very small example something that they could interesting the nurses themselves sort snap into action said embrace this what can the first thing they they rated the ceiling which thought was really showed this mother recently think mother now think that some sort interior decorator s what for living sort laurence llewelyn not particularly the world s best design solution for those who are real sort hard core designers but nonetheless fabulous empathic solution for people things that they started doing themselves like changing the floor going into the patient s room that sign ified this room this personal space was really interesting sort design solution the problem you went from public space private space and another idea again that came from one the nurses which love was they took traditional sort corporate white boards then they put them one wall the patient s room and they put this stick there that what you could actually was into the room and write message the person who was sick that room which was love tiny tiny tiny solutions that made huge amount impact thought that was really really nice example this not particularly new idea kind seeing opportunities things that are around you and snap ping and turning them into solution s history invention based around this going read this because want get these name right joan ganz cooney saw her daughter came down saturday morning saw her daughter watching the test card waiting for program come one morning and from that came same street malcolm clean was moving from one country another and was wonder why took these guys long get the boxes the ship and invented the ship ping contain george tral this not bug all over birken stock was walking his dog field and got covered burr sort little rick things and from that came velcro and finally for the brits percy shaw this big british invention saw the cat s eyes the side the road when was driving home one night and from that came the cat there s whole series just using your eyes seeing things for the first time seeing things fresh and using them opportunity create new possibilities second one without sound over zen and this quote from the buddha finding yourself the margin looking the edge things often really interesting place start blinkered vision tend produce think blinkered solutions looking wide using your peripheral vision really interesting place look for opportunity again another medical example here were asked device produce did the palm pilot and the treo did lot sexy tech ideo they seen this and they wanted sexy piece technology for medical diagnostic this was device that nurse uses when they doing spinal procedure hospital they ask the nurses data and they had this vision the nurse kind click away this aluminum device and all being incredibly sort gadget lust when actually went and watched this procedure taking place and explain this second became very obvious that there was human dimension this that they really weren recognizing when you having four inch need insert into your spine which was the procedure that this device s data was about was for pain management you shit cared you freak out and the first thing that pretty much every nurse did was hold the patient s hand comfort them human gesture which made the fabulous two handed data completely impossible the thing that designed much less sexy but much more human and practical was this s not palm pilot any stretch the imagination but has thumb scroll you can everything with one hand again going back this the idea that tiny human gesture dictate the design this product and think that s really really important again this idea work around use this phrase work around lot sort looking around was actually looking around the ted and just watching all these kind things happen while been here this idea the way that people cobble together solutions our life and the things kind our environment that are some what conscious but have huge potential something that look lot wrote book recently think you might have received called thought less acts s been all about these kind thought less things that people which have huge intention and huge opportunity why all follow the line the street this picture japanese people conscious follow things even though why don know why line the square milk with the square fence because kind have just don know why but why wrap the string around the handle again sort using the world around create our own design solutions and always saying our clients you should look this stuff this stuff really important this stuff really vital this people designing their own experience you can draw from this sort assume that because there s pole the street that s okay use park our shopping there s there for our use some level again sort opt our environment all these different things opt other experience take one and transfer another and this favorite one mother used say just because your sister jump the lake doesn mean you have but course all all follow each other every day somebody assume that because somebody else has done something that s permission for them the same thing and there s almost this sort semaphore around all the time mean shopping bag equal parking meter out order and all kind know how read these signals now all talk one another this highly visual way without realizing what doing third section this idea not know conscious putting yourself backwards talk about thinking situation all the time sort having begin s mind crap your mind clean and looking things fresh friend mine was designer ikea and was asked his boss help design storage system for children this the bill book case s ikea s biggest selling product hammer together hammer together with shoe you because they impossible assemble but big selling book case how replicate this for children the reality when you actually watch children children don think about things like storage linear terms children assume permission very different way children live things they live under things they live around things and their spatial awareness relationship and their thinking around storage totally different the first thing you have this graham the designer sort put yourself their shoes and here sitting under the table what came out this this the storage system that designed what this hear you all ask don s this and think this particularly love solution you know s totally different way looking the situation s completely empathic solution apart from the fact that s probably not loving but really nice way fram the ordinary and think that s one the things and putting yourself the position the person and think that s one the threads that heard again from this conference how put ourselves other people shoes and really feel what they feel and then use that information fuel solutions and think that s what this very much about last section green band all got them s about this really mean s about pick battle big enough matter but small enough win again that s one the themes that think has come through loud and clear this conference where start how start what start again were asked design water pump for company called approtec kenya they now called kick start and again designers wanted make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend lot time thinking the form and that was completely relevant when you put yourself the position these people things like the fact that this has able fold and fit bicycle become much more relevant than the form the way s produced has produced with indigenous manufacturing methods and indigenous materials had looked completely from the point view the user had completely transfer ourselves over their world what seems like very clunky product fact incredibly useful s power bit like stair master you pump and down children can use adults can use everybody uses s turning these guys again one the themes s turning them into entrepreneur these guys are using this very successful and for s been great because s won loads design award actually managed reconcile the needs the design company the needs the individual the company feel good about product were actually designing and the needs the individual were designing for there pump water from feet final gesture handed out these bracelets all you this morning made ation everybody s behalf here kick start pun intended their next project because again think sort putting our money where our mouth here feel that this important gesture handed out bracelets small the new big hope you all wear them that s thank you
