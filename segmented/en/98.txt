biologist richard dawkins makes case for thinking the improbable looking how the human frame reference limits our understanding the universe astronomy biology cognitive science cosmos evolution physics psychology science richard dawkins the universe queerer than can suppose title queerer than can suppose the strange ness science queerer than can suppose comes from s haldane the famous biologist who said now own suspicion that the universe not only queerer than suppose but queerer than can suppose suspect that there are more things heaven and earth than are dream can dream any philosophy richard feynman compared the accuracy quantum ories experimental prediction specifying the width north america within one hair s bread accuracy this means that quantum theory has got some sense true yet the assumption that quantum theory needs make order deliver those prediction are mysterious that even feynman himself was moved remark you think you understand quantum theory you don understand quantum theory s queer that physicist sort one another paradox ical interpretation david deutsch who s talking here the fabric reality embrace the many world interpretation quantum theory because the worst that you can say about that s preposterous waste postulate vast and rapidly growing number universe existing parallel mutual undetec table except through the narrow port hole quantum mechanical experiment and that s richard feynman the biologist lewis wolpert believe that the queer ness modern physics just extreme example science opposed technology does violence common sense every time you drink glass water point out the odds are that you will least one molecule that passed through the bladder liver cromwell s just element probability theory the number molecules per glass huge greater than the number glass bladder the world and course there s nothing special about cromwell bladder you have just breath nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung the third iguano the left the cycad tree queerer than can suppose what that makes capable anything and does this tell anything about what can suppose are there things about the universe that will ever beyond our grasp but not beyond the grasp some superior intelligence are there things about the universe that are principle grasp able any mind however superior the history science has been one long series violent brainstorms success generation have come terms with increasing level queer ness the universe now used the idea that the earth rather than the sun move across the sky s hard for realize what shatter mental revolution that must have been after all seems obvious that the earth large and motion less the sun small and mobile but s worth calling wittgenstein s remark the subject tell asked friend why people always say was natural for man assume that the sun went round the earth rather than that the earth was rotating his friend replied well obviously because just looks though the sun going round the earth wittgenstein replied well what would have looked like had looked though the earth was rotating science has taught against all intuition that apparently solid things like crystal and rock are really almost entirely compose empty space and the familiar illustration the nucleus atom fly the middle sports stadium and the next atom the next sports stadium would seem the hardest solid dense rock really almost entirely empty space broken only tiny particle widely space they shouldn count why then rock look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable evolutionary biologist say this our brains have evolved help survive within the order magnitude size and speed which our bodies operate never evolved navigate the world atoms had our brains probably would perceive rock full empty space rock feel hard and impenetrable our hands precisely because objects like rock and hands cannot penetr each other s therefore useful for our brains construct notion like solid and penetr ability because such notion help navigate our bodies through the middle sized world which have navigate moving the other end the scale our ancestor never had navigate through the cosmos speed close the speed light they had our brains would much better understanding einstein want give the name middle world the medium scale environment which evolved the ability take act nothing with middle earth middle world are evolved denizens middle world and that limits what are capable imagining find intuitive easy grasp ideas like when rabbit move the sort medium velocity which rabbit and other middle world objects move and hits another middle world object like rock knock itself out may introduce major general albert stubblebine comm military intelligence star his wall arlingt virginia and decided frightening the prospect was was going into the next office stood and moved out from behind his desk what the atom mostly made thought space started walking what mostly made atoms quick ened his pace almost jog now what the wall mostly made atoms all have merge the space then general stubblebine bang his nose hard the wall his office stubblebine who comm soldiers was founded his continual failure walk through the wall has doubt that this ability will one day common tool the military arsenal who would screw around with army that could that that s from article play which was reading the other day have every reason think s true was reading play because myself had article human intuition school middle world find hard believe galileo when tells heavy object and light object air friction side would hit the ground the same instant and that s because middle world air friction always there evolved vacuum would expect them hit the ground simultaneously were bacteria constantly buffe rmal movement molecules would different but middle world are too big notice brown motion the same way our lives are dominated gravity but are almost obliv ious the force surface tension small insect would reverse these priorities steve grand s the one the left doug the right steve grand his book creation life and how make positive thing about our occupation with matter itself have this tendency think that only solid material things are really things all wave electro magnetic ation vacuum seem real victorians thought the wave had wave some material medium the but find real matter comfort only because evolved survive middle world where matter useful fiction whirl pool for steve grand thing with just much reality rock desert plain tanzania the shadow the volcano lengai there s dune made volcanic ash the beautiful thing that move bodily s what s technically known barchan and the entire dune walk across the desert west direction speed about meters per year retain crescent shape and move the direction the horn what happens that the wind blow the the shallow slope the other side and then each grain hits the top the ridge cascades down the inside the crescent and the whole horn shaped dune move steve grand point out that you and are ourselves more like wave than permanent thing invite the reader think experience from your childhood something you remember clearly something you can see feel maybe even smell you were really there after all you really were there the time weren you how else would you remember but here the bomb shell you weren there not single atom that your body today was there when that even took place matter flow from place place and moment rily comes together you whatever you are therefore you are not the stuff which you are made that doesn make the hair stand the back your neck read again until does because important really isn word that should use with simple confidence neutrino had brain which evolved neutrino sized ancestor would say that rock really consist empty space have brains that evolved medium sized ancestor which couldn walk through rock really for animal whatever brain needs order assist survival and because different species live different world there will comfort variety really s what see the real world not the unvarnished world but model the world regul ated and just sense data but construct s useful for dealing with the real world the nature the model depend the kind animal are flying animal needs different kind model from walking climb swimming animal monkey s brain must have software capable simul ating three dimensional world branch and trunk mole s software for construct models world will customized for under ground use water strider s brain doesn need software all since lives the surface the pond ed abbott flat land speculate that bats may see color with their ears the world model that bat needs order navigate through three dimension catch insects must pretty similar the world model that any flying bird day flying bird like swallow needs perform the same kind task the fact that the bat uses echoes pitch dark ness the current variable model while the swallow uses light incident bats even suggest use perceive hues such red and blue label internal label for some useful aspect echoes perhaps the acoustic texture surface furry smooth and the same way swallow indeed use those perceive hues ness and blue ness etc label long and short wave length light there s nothing inherent about red that makes long wave length and the point that the nature the model govern how used rather than the sensory modal involved s haldane himself had something say about animals whose world dominated smell dogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acid extremely dilu caprylic acid and caproic acid the only difference you see that one has extra pair carbon atoms the chain haldane guess that dog would probably able place the acid the order their molecular weight their smell just man could place number piano wire the order their length means their notes now there s another fatty acid capric acid which just like the other two except that has two more carbon atoms dog that had never met capric acid would perhaps have more trouble imagining smell than would have trouble imagining trumpet say playing one note higher than heard trumpet play before perhaps dogs and rhinos and other smell oriented animals smell color and the argument would exactly the same for the bats middle world the range size and speed which have evolved feel intuitive comfortable with bit like the narrow range the electro magnetic spectrum that see light various color blind all frequencies outside that unless use instrument help middle world the narrow range reality which judge normal opposed the queer ness the very small the very large and the very fast could make similar scale improbabil ities nothing totally impossible miracle are just events that are extremely improbable marble statue could wave hand the atoms that make crystal line structure are all vibr ating back and forth anyway because there are many them and because there s agree ment among them their preferred direction movement the marble see middle world stay rock steady but the atoms the hand could all just happen move the same way the same time and again and again this case the hand would move and see waving middle world the odds against course are great that you set out writing zero the time the origin the universe you still would not have written enough zero this day evolution middle world has not equipped handle very improbable events don live long enough the vast ness astronomical space and logical time that which seems impossible middle world might turn out inevitable one way think about that count planets don know how many planets there are the universe but good estimate about the billion billion and that gives nice way express our estimate life s probability could make some sort land mark point along spectrum probability which might look like the electro magnetic spectrum just looked life has arisen only once any life could mean life could originate once per planet could extremely common could originate once per star once per galaxy maybe only once the entire universe which case would have here and somewhere there would the chance that frog would turn into prince and similar magical things like that life has arisen only one planet the entire universe that planet has our planet because here are talking about and that means that want avail ourselves allowed postulate chemical events the origin life which have probability low one billion billion don think hall have avail ourselves that because suspect that life quite common the universe and when say quite common could still rare that one island life ever counter another which sad thought how hall interpret queerer than can suppose queerer than can principle supposed just queerer than can suppose given the limit ations our brain s evolutionary apprenticeship middle world could training and practice emancipate ourselves from middle world and achieve some sort intuitive well mathematical understanding the very small and the very large genuine don know the answer wonder whether might help ourselves understand say quantum theory brought children play computer games beginning early childhood which had sort make believe world ball going through two slits screen world which the strange going quantum mechanics were enlarged the computer s make believe that they became familiar the middle world scale the stream and similar relativ istic computer game which objects the screen manifest the lorenz contract and try get ourselves into the way thinking get children into the way thinking about want end apply the idea middle world our perception each other most scientists today sub mechanistic view the mind the way are because our brains are wired they are our hormone are the way they are different our character would different our neuro anatomy and our physio logical chemistry were different but scientists are consistent were consistent our response having person like child murder should something like this unit has fault component needs repair that s not what say what say and include the most austere mechanistic among which probably what say monster prison too good for you worse seek revenge all probability there trigger the next phase escalat cycle counter revenge which see course all over the world today short when thinking like academic regard people elaborate and complicated machines like computers cars but when revert being human have more like basil fawlty who remember thrashed his car teach lesson when wouldn start gourmet night the reason person things like cars and computers that just monkey live real world and mole live under ground world and water strider live surface tension dominated flat land live social world swim through sea people social version middle world are evolved second guess the behavior others becoming brilliant intuitive psychologist treating people machines may scientific ally and philosophical accurate but s cumber some waste time you want guess what this person going next the economically useful way model person treat him purpose goal seek agent with pleasure and pain desire and intention guilt blame worth ness person ation and the intentional purpose such brilliant successful way model humans s hardly surprising the same model software often seize control when trying think about entities for which s not appropriate like basil fawlty with his car like millions deluded people with the universe whole the universe queerer than can suppose just because been natural elected suppose only what needed suppose order survive the pleistocene africa are our brains versatile and expand able that can train ourselves break out the box our evolution finally are there some things the universe queer that philosophy beings however like could dream them
