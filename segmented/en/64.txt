lady don know that that would have been life ambition but want talk little bit about happiness and the relationship this whole vagina journey because has been extraordinary journey that began eight years ago think before did the vagina monologues didn really believe happiness thought that only idiot were happy honest remember when started practic buddhism years ago and was told that the end this practice was happy said how could you happy and live this world suffering and live this world pain took happiness for lot other things like numb ness decade selfish ness and what happened through the course the vagina monologues and this journey think have come understand little bit more about happiness there three qualities want talk about one seeing what s right front you and talking about and stat think what learned from talking about the vagina and speaking about the vagina was the most obvious thing was right the center body and the center the world and yet was the one thing nobody talked about the second thing that what talking about the vagina did opened this door which allowed see that there was way serve the world make better and that s where the deep happiness has actually come from and the third principle happiness which realized recently eight years ago this momentum and this energy this wave started and can only describe wave because honest really don understand completely feel the service but this wave started and question the wave try stop the wave look back the wave often have the experience whip lash the potential neck break but with the wave and trust the wave and move with the wave the next place and happens logical and organic ally and truth fully and started this piece particularly with stories and narrative and was talking one woman and that led another woman and that led another woman and then wrote those stories down and put them out front other people and every single time did the show the beginning women would literally line after the show because they wanted tell their stories and first thought great hear about wonderful orgasm and great sex lives and how women love their vagina but fact that s not what women line tell what women line tell was how they were raped and how they were battered and how they were beaten and how they were gang raped parking lots and how they were their uncle and wanted stop doing the vagina monologues because felt too daunting felt like war photographer who takes pictures terrible events but doesn intervene their behalf and said let s get women together what could with this information that all these women are being violate and turned out after thinking and investigating that discovered and the has actually said this recently that one out every three women this planet will beaten raped her life time that s essentially gender that s essentially resource the planet which women got all these incredible women together and said how can use the play this energy stop violence against women and put one even new york city the theater and all these great actor came from saran glenn close gold berg and did one performance one evening and that catalyzed this wave this energy and within five years this extraordinary thing began happen one woman took that energy and she said want bring this wave this energy college camp uses and she took the play and she said let s use the play and have performance the play once year where can raise money stop violence against women local communities all around the world and one year went college and then expanded and over the course the last six years s spread and s spread and s spread and s spread around the world what have learned two things one that the epidemic violence towards women shock s global profound and devastating and every little pocket every little crater every little society that don even recognize because s become ordinary this journey has taken afghanistan where had the extraordinary honor and privilege into parts afghanistan under the taliban was dressed burqa and went with extraordinary group called the evolutionary association the women afghanistan and saw first hand how women had been stripped every single right that was possible trip women from being educated being employed being actually allowed eat ice cream for those you who don know was illegal eat ice cream under the taliban and actually saw and met women who had been flogged being caught eating vanilla ice cream and was taken the secret ice cream eating place little town where went back room and women were seat and curtain was pulled around and they were served vanilla ice cream and women lifted their burqa and ate this ice cream and don think ever understood pleasure until that moment and how women have found way keep their pleasure alive has taken this journey where have witnessed and met women with their face melt off has taken juarez mexico where was week ago where have literally been there parking lots where bone women have washed and been dump next bottle has taken universities all over this country where girls are date raped and drug have seen terrible terrible terrible violence but have also recognize the course seeing that violence that being the face things and seeing actually what s front the anti depression and feeling that one worth less and has value because before the vagina monologues will say that percent consciousness was closed off what was really going this reality and that losing off closed off vital and life energy what has also happened the course these travel and s been extraordinary thing that every single place that have gone the world have met new species and really love hearing about all these species the bottom the sea and was thinking about how being with these extraordinary people this particular panel that s beneath beyond and between and the vagina kind fits into all those categories but one the things seen this species and species and new paradigm and doesn get reported the press the media because don think good news ever news and don think people who are transform the planet are what gets the rating shows but every single country have been and the last six years been about countries and many tiny little village and cities and towns have seen something what come call vagina warrior vagina warrior woman vagina friendly man who has witnessed incredible violence suffer and rather than getting weapon mass destruction machete they hold the violence their bodies they grieve they experience and then they out and vote their lives making sure doesn happen anybody else have met these women everywhere the planet and want tell few stories because believe that stories are the way that trans information where goes into our bodies and think that one the things about being ted that s been very interesting that live body lot and don live head very much anymore and this very head place and s been really interesting head for the last two days been very oriented because think the world the world very much your body s body world and the species really exists the body and think there s real significance attach our bodies our head that that separation has created divide that often separating purpose from tent and the connection between body and head often bring those things into union want talk about three particular people that met vagina warrior who really transform understanding this whole principle and species and one woman named marsh lopez marsh lopez was woman met guatemala she was years old and she was marriage and her husband was beat
