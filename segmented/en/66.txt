sir ken robinson makes entertaining and profound moving case for creating education system that nurtu creativity children creativity culture dance education parenting ken robinson says school kill creativity good morning how are you s been great hasn been blown away the whole thing fact leaving there have been three themes haven there running through the conference which are relevant what want talk about one the extraordinary evidence human creativity all the presentation that had and all the people here just the variety and the range the second that s put place where have idea what s going happen terms the future idea how this may play out have interest education actually what find everybody has interest education don you find this very interesting you dinner party and you say you work education actually you not often dinner parties frankly you work education you not asked and you never asked back curious that s strange but you are and you say somebody you know they say what you and you say you work education you can see the blood run from their face they like god you know why one night out all week but you ask about their education they pin you the wall because s one those things that goes deep with people right like religion and money and other things have big interest education and think all have huge vested interest part because s education that s meant take into this future that can grasp you think children starting school this year will reti ring nobody has clue despite all the expertise that s been parade for the past four days what the world will look like five years time and yet meant educating them for the predict ability think extraordinary and the third part this that all agreed nonetheless the really extraordinary capacities that children have their capacities for innovation mean sirena last night was marvel wasn she just seeing what she could and she s exception but think she s not speak exception the whole childhood what you have there person extraordinary dedication who found talent and content all kids have tremendous talent and them pretty ruth less want talk about education and want talk about creativity content that creativity now important education literacy and should treat with the same status thank you that was the way thank you very much minutes left well was born heard great story recently love telling little girl who was drawing lesson she was six and she was the back drawing and the teacher said this little girl hardly ever paid attention and this drawing lesson she did the teacher was fascinated and she went over her and she said what are you drawing and the girl said drawing picture god and the teacher said but nobody know what god looks like and the girl said they will minute when was four england actually was four everywhere honest being strict about wherever went was four that year was the nativity play you remember the story was big was big story gibs did the sequel you may have seen nativity but james got the part joseph which were thrilled about considered this one the lead parts had the place rammed full agent shirt james robinson joseph didn have speak but you know the bit where the three king come they come bear gift and they bring gold frank cense and myrhh this really happened were sitting there and think they just went out sequence because talked the little boy after ward and said you with that and said yeah why was that wrong they just switch that was anyway the three boys came four year olds with tea towel their head and they put these boxes down and the first boy said bring you gold and the second boy said bring you myrhh and the third boy said frank sent this what these things have common that kids will take chance they don know they have right they not frightened being wrong now don mean say that being wrong the same thing being creative what know you not prepared wrong you never come with anything original you not prepared wrong and the time they get adults most kids have lost that capacity they have become frightened being wrong and run our companies like this the way stigmat mistakes and now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make and the result that are educating people out their creative capacities picas once said this said that all children are born artists the problem remain artist grow believe this passionate that don grow into creativity grow out rather get educated out why this lived stratford until about five years ago fact moved from stratford los angeles you can imagine what seamless transition that was actually lived place called snitter field just outside stratford which where shakespeare s father was born are you struck new thought was you don think shakespeare having father you you because you don think shakespeare being child you shakespeare being seven never thought mean was seven some point was somebody s english class wasn how annoy would that must try harder being sent bed his dad you know shakespeare bed now william shakespeare and put the pencil down and stop speaking like that s confusing everybody anyway moved from stratford los angeles and just want say word about the transition actually didn want come got two kids s now daughter s didn want come los angeles loved but had girl friend england this was the love his life sarah known her for month mind you they had their fourth anniversary because s long time when you anyway was really upset the plane and said never find another girl like sarah and were rather please about that frankly because she was the main reason were leaving the country but something strikes you when you move america and when you travel around the world every education system earth has the same hierarchy subject every one doesn matter where you you think would otherwise but isn the top are mathematics and languages then the human ities and the bottom are the arts everywhere earth and pretty much every system too there s hierarchy within the arts art and music are normally given higher status school than drama and dance there isn education system the planet that teaches dance everyday children the way teach them mathematics why why not think this rather important think math very important but dance children dance all the time they allowed all all have bodies don did miss meeting truth fully what happens children grow start educate them progress from the waist and then focus their head you were visit education alien and say what s for public education think you have conclude you look the who really succeed this who does everything that they should who gets all the brown point who are the winners think you have conclude the whole purpose public education throughout the world produce university professors isn they the people who come out the top and used one there and like university professors but you know shouldn hold them the high water mark all human achieve ment they just form life another form life but they rather curious and say this out affect for them there s something curious about professors experience not all them but typically they live their head they live there and light one side they disembo died you know kind literal way they look upon their body form transport for their head don they s way getting their head meeting you want real evidence out body experience the way get yourself along resident conference senior academic and pop into the discotheque the final night and there you will see grown men and women thing uncont ably off the beat waiting until end they can home and write paper about now our education system predic ated the idea academic ability and there s reason the whole system was invented around the world there were public systems education really before the century they all came into being meet the needs industrial the hierarchy root two ideas number one that the most useful subject for work are the top you were probably stee benign away from things school when you were kid things you liked the ground that you would never get job doing that that right don music you not going musician don art you won artist benign advice now profound mistake the whole world engulf revolution and the second academic ability which has really come domi our view intelligence because the universities designed the system their image you think the whole system public education around the world tract process university trance and the consequence that many highly talent brilliant creative people think they not because the thing they were good school wasn value was actually stigmat ized and think can afford that way the next years according more people worldwide will gradu ating through education than since the beginning history more people and s the combination all the things talked about technology and transformation effect work and ography and the huge explosion population suddenly degrees aren worth anything isn that true when was student you had degree you had job you didn have job s because you didn want one and didn want one frankly but now kids with degrees are often head home carry playing video games because you need where the previous job require and now you need for the other s process academic inflation and indicate the whole structure education shift beneath our feet need radical think our view intelligence know three things about intelligence one s diverse think about the world all the ways that experience think visual think sound think kinesthetic ally think abstract terms think movement secondly intelligence dynamic you look the interaction human brain heard yesterday from number presentation intelligence wonderful interactive the brain isn divide into compartment fact creativity which define the process having original ideas that have value more often than not comes about through the interaction different disciplinary ways seeing things the brain intentional the way there s shaft nerve that join the two halve the brain called the corpus call s thick women following off from helen yesterday think this probably why women are better multi task because you are aren you there s raft research but know from personal life wife cooking meal home which not often thank fully but you know she s doing she s good some things but she s cooking you know she s dealing

future the way may not see this future but they will and our job help them make something thank you very much
