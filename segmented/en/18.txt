this spir talk about recent develop ment biomimicry janine benyus provide heart example way which nature already the products and systems build dna animals biology biomimicry design environment evolution fish science technology janine benyus share nature s design thrill here conference that s devot inspired nature you can imagine and also thrill the foreplay section did you notice this section foreplay because get talk about one favorite critters which the western grebe you haven lived until you seen these guys their courtship dance was bow lake glacier national park which long skinny lake with sort mountain side down and partner and have rowing shell and were rowing and one these western grebe came along and what they for their courtship dance they together the two them the two mat and they begin run under water they paddl faster and faster and faster until they going fast that they literally lift out the water and they stand right sort paddl the top the water and one these grebe came along while were rowing and skull and moving really really quickly and this grebe think sort mistaked for pro and started run along the water next courtship dance for miles would stop and then start and then stop and then start now that foreplay came this close changing species that moment obviously life can teach something the entertainment section life has lot teach but what like talk about today what life might teach technology and design what s happened since the book came out the book was mainly about research biomimicry and what s happened since then architect designer engineer people who make our world have started call and say want logist the design table help real time become inspired and this the fun part for want you take out into the natural world come with design challenge and find the champi adapt the natural world who might spire this picture from galapagos trip that took with some waste water treatment engineer they purify waste water and some them were very resistant actually being there what they said first was you know already biomimicry use bacteria clean our water and said well that s not exactly being inspired nature that s process you know that s bio assisted technology using organism your waste water treatment old old technology called domestic ation this learning something learning idea from organism and then apply and they still were getting went for walk the beach and said well give one your big problems give design challenge sustain ability speed bump that s keep you from being sustainable and they said scaling which the build mineral inside pipes and they said you know what happens mineral just like your house mineral build and then the aperture close and have flush the pipes with toxins have dig them had some way stop this scaling and pick some shell the beach and asked them what scaling what s inside your pipes and they said calcium carbon and said that s what this this calcium carbon and they didn know that they didn know that what shell s templated protein and then ions from the seawater crystal place create shell the same sort process without the protein happening the inside their pipes they didn know this not for lack information s lack ation you know s silo people silo they didn know that the same thing was happening one them thought about and said well this just crystallization that happens automatically out seawater self assembly then why aren shell finite size what stop the scaling why don they just keep going and said well the same way that they exude protein and start the crystallization and then they all sort lean they let protein that stop the crystallization literally adheres the grow face the crystal and fact there product called tpa that s mimicked that protein that stop protein and s environmental friend way stop scaling pipes that changed everything from then you could not get these engineer back the boat the first day they would take hike and was click click click click five minutes later they were back the boat done you know seen that land after this they were crawl all over they would snorkel for long would let them snorkel what had happened was that they realized that there were organism out there that had already solved the problems that they had spent their care trying solve learning about the natural world one thing learning from the natural world that s the switch that s the found switch what they realized was that the answer their question are every where they just needed change the lenses with which they saw the world billion years field test craig venter will probably tell you think there s lot more than million well adapt solution the important thing for that these are solution solved context and the context the earth the same context that trying solve our problems s the conscious emul ation life s genius s not slavish mimicking although trying get the hair going s not slavish mimic s taking the design principle the genius the natural world and learning something from now group with many people have mention what not going talk about and that that your field one that has learn enormous amount from living things the software side there s computer that protect themselves like immune system and learning from gene regul ation and biological develop and learning from neural net genetic algorithms evolution com that s the software side but what s interesting that haven looked this much mean these machine are really not very high tech estim ation the sense that there s dozen and dozen carcino the water silicon valley the hardware not all snuff terms what life would call success what can learn about making not just computer but everything the plane you came cars the seats that you sitting how design the world that make the human made world more important what should ask the next years and there s lot cool technologies out there that life has what s the syllabus three question for are key how does life make things this the opposite this how make things s called heat and treat that s what material scientist call and s car things down from the top with percent waste left over and only percent product you heat you with high pressure you use chemical heat and treat life can afford that how does life make things how does life make the most things that s geranium pollen and it shape what give the function being able tumble through air easily look that shape life add information matter other words structure give information add information matter give function that s different than without that structure and third how does life make things disappear into systems because life doesn really deal things there are things the natural world divorce from their systems really quick syllabus reading more and more now and follo the story there are some amazing things coming the biological science and the same time listen lot business and finding what their sort grand challenge are the two group are not talking each other all what the world biology might help this juncture get through this sort evolution knothole that going try through really quickly one that s exciting self assembly now you heard about this terms nano technology back that shell the shell self assembling material the low left there picture mother pearl form out seawater s layered structure that s mineral and then polymer and makes very very tough s twice tough our high tech ceramics but what s really interesting unlike our ceramics that are kilns happens seawater happens near and near the organism s body this sandia national lab guy named jeff brinker has found way have self assembling process imagine being able make ceramics room temperature simply dipp something into liquid lift out the liquid and having vapor ation force the molecules the liquid together that they jig together the same way this crystallization work imagine making all our hard material that way imagine pray the precursors cell solar cell roof and having self assemble into layered structure that harvest light here s interesting one for the world bio silicon this diatom which made silicates and silicon which make right now s part our carcino genic problem the ufacture our chips this bio mineral ization process that s now being mimicked this santa barbara look these diatom this from ernst haeckel s work imagine being able and again s templated process and lidifies out liquid process imagine being able have that sort structure coming out room temperature imagine being able make perfect lenses the left this brittle star s covered with lenses that the people lucent technologies have found have distortion what ever s one the most distortion free lenses know and there s many them all over it entire body what s interesting again that self assemble woman named joanna aizenberg lucent now learning this low temperature process create these sort lenses she s also looking fiber optic that s sea sponge that has fiber optic down the very base there s fiber optic that work better than our actually move light but you can tie them they incredibly flexible here s another big idea feed guy named coates cornell said self you know plant not see the biggest poison our time see that way plant are bus making long chain star and glucose right out s found way s found catalyst and s found way take and make into polycarbonates degrad plastic out how plant like solar trans ation the most exciting one there are people who are mimicking the energy harvest device inside pur bacterium the people even more interesting late the last couple week people have seen that there s enzyme called hydrogenase that s able evolve hydrogen from pro and electrons and able take hydrogen basically what s happening fuel cell the anode fuel cell and reversible fuel cell our fuel cells with platinum life does with very very common iron and team has now just been able mimic that hydrogen juggl hydrogenase that s very exciting for fuel cells able that without platinum power shape here s whale seen that the fins this whale have tubercles them and those little bump actually increase efficiency for instance the edge airplane increase efficiency about percent which amazing fossil fuel savings were just put that the edge wing color without pigments this cock creating color with shape light comes through bounces back off the lay s called thin film inter ence imagine being able self assemble products with the last few lay play with light create color imagine being able create shape the side face that s self clean with just water that s what leaf does see that close picture that s water and those are dirt articles and that s close picture lot leaf there s company making product called lot which mimic when the building facade paint dries mimic the bump self clean leaf and rain water clean the building water going our big grand challenge quench thirst here are two organism that pull water the one the left the namibian pull water out fog the one the right bug pull water out air does not drink fresh water pull water out monterey fog and out the sweat air atlanta before gets into building are key technologies separ ation technologies are going extremely important what were say more hard rock mining what were separate out metals from waste stream small amount metals water that s what microbes they late metals out water there s company here francisco called that embed mimic the microbes molecules filter mine waste stream green chemistry chemistry water chemistry organ solve this picture the spinnerets coming out spider and the silk being form from spider isn that beautiful green chemistry replacing our industrial chemistry with nature s recipe book s not easy because life uses only sub the element the period table and use all them even the toxic one figure out the elegant recipe that would take the small sub the period table and create miracle material like that cell the task green chemistry time degrad ation pack aging that good until you don want good more and solve cue that s mussel you can find the water out here and the read hold rock are time exactly two years they begin solve healing this good one that little guy over there tardigrade there problem with vaccine around the world not getting patients and the reason that the refrigeration somehow gets broken what s called the cold chain gets broken guy named bruce ros looked the tardigrade which dries out completely and yet stay for months and months and months and able rate self and found way dry out vaccine case them the same sort sugar capsules the tardigrade has with it cells meaning that vaccine longer need refrigerated they can put love com ment learning from organism this session about water learning about organism that can without water order create vaccine that last and last and last without refrigeration not going get but what going tell you that the most important thing besides all these adapt ation the fact that these organism have figured out way the amazing things they while taking care the place that s going take care their offspring when they involved foreplay they thinking about something very very important and that s having their genetic material remain generation from now and that means finding way what they without destroy the place that take care their offspring that s the biggest design challenge luckily there are million and million genius will gift with their best ideas good luck having conversation with them thank you chris anderson talk about foreplay need get but really quickly janine benyus really yeah just like you know like the second version and because just your slide are gorgeous and the ideas are big can stand let you down without seeing and put this just hold this thing great that s the healing one sensing and respond feed huge thing this locust there can million them square kilo and yet they don collide with one another and yet have million car collision year right there s person new who has figured out that s very large neuron and she s actually figuring out how make collision avoid circuit based this very large neuron the locust this huge and important one number and that s the grow fertility that means you know net fertility farm should grow fertility and yes get food too because have grow the cap city this planet create more and more opportunities for life and really that s what other organism well ensemble that s what whole systems they create more and more opportunities for life our farm has done the opposite farm based how prairie build ran based how native ungu her actually increase the health the range even waste water treatment based how mars not only clean the water but create incredibly sparkl product this the simple design brief mean looks simple because the system over billion years has worked this out that those organism that have not been able figure out how enhance sweet their place are not around tell about that s the twelfth one life and this the secret trick this the magic trick life create conditions conduci life build clean air clean water mix the cock gas that you and need live and does that the middle having great foreplay and meeting their needs s not mutu clusi have find way meet our needs while making this place janine thank you much
