featured antidepressants cognitive science culture evolution gender love psycho relationship science sex women helen fish tell why love che like talk today about the two biggest social trend the coming century and perhaps the next years but want start with work romantic love because that s most recent work what and colleagues did was put people who were madly love into function mri brain scanner who were madly love and their love was accepted and who were madly love and they had just been dumped and want tell you about that first and then into where think love going what love shakespeare said think our ancestors think human being have been wonder about this question since they around their campfire lay and watch the star million years ago started out trying figure out what romantic love was looking the last years research just the psycho logical research and turns out there s very specific group things that happen when you fall love the first thing that happens what call person begin take what call special meaning truck river once said said the world had new center and that center was mary george rnard shaw said little different said love consists over mating the difference between one woman and another and indeed that s what and then you just focus this person you can list what you don like about them but then you sweep that side and focus what you chaucer said love blind trying understand romantic love decided would read poe from all over the world and just want give you one very short poem from eighth century china because s almost perfect example man who focus totally particular woman s little bit like when you are madly love with somebody and you walk into park lot their car different from every other car the park lot their wine glass dinner different from every other wine glass the dinner part and this case man got hooked bamboo sleeping mat and goes like this s guy called yuan che can put away the bamboo sleeping mat the night brought you home watch you roll out became hooked sleeping mat probably because elevated activity dopamine his brain just like with you and but anyway not only does this person take special meaning you focus your attenti them you grand them but you have intense energy one polynesian said said felt like jump the you all night you walk till dawn you feel intense elation when things are going well mood wing into horrible despair when things are going poor real depend this person one business new york said said anything she like like simple romantic love very simple you become extremely sexual possessive you know you just sleeping with somebody casual you don really care they sleeping with somebody else but the moment you fall love you become extremely sexual possessive them think that that darwinian there s darwinian purpose this the whole point this pull two people together strong enough begin babies team but the main characteristic romantic love are craving intense craving with particular person not just sexual but emotion you much rather would nice bed with them but you want them call you the tele phone invite you out etc tell you that they love you the other main characteristic motivation the motor your brain begin crank and you want this person and last but not least session when put these people the machine before put them the mri machine would ask them all kinds question but most important question was always the same was what percent the day and night you think about this person and indeed they would say all day all night can never stop thinking about him her and then the very last question would ask them would always have work myself this question because not psycho logist don work with people any kind traumatic situation and final question was always the same would say would you die for him her and indeed these people would say yes had asked them pass the salt was just staggered scanned their brain looking photograph their sweet heart and looking neutral photograph with dis action task between could look the same brain when was that eight state and when was rest state and found activity lot brain region fact one the most important was brain region that become active when you feel the rush cocaine and indeed that s exactly what happens began realize that romantic love not emotion fact had always thought was series emotion from very high very low but actually s drive comes from the motor the mind the want part the mind the craving part the mind the kind mind part the mind when you reach for that piece choco when you want win that pro work the motor the brain s drive and fact think s more powerful than the sex drive you know you ask somebody bed with you and they say thank you you certainly don kill your slip into clinical depressi but certainly around the world people who are jected love will kill for people live for love they kill for love they die for love they have song poem novel sculptures paint legend over societies people have left their evi ence this powerful brain system have come think s one the most powerful brain systems earth for both great joy and great rrow and also come think that s one three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and production one the sex drive the craving for sexual gratific ation auden called into able neural and indeed that s what keep both you little bit like being hungry the second these three brain systems romantic love that elation session early love and the third brain system attachment that sense calm and security you can feel for long term partner and think that the sex drive evolved get you out there looking for whole range partner you know you can feel when you just driving along your car can focus nobody think romantic love evolved enable you focus your mating energy just one individual time there conserv mating time and energy and think that attachment the third brain system evolved enable you rate this human being least long enough raise child together team with that preamble want into discuss the two most found social trend one the last years and the other certainly the last years that are going have impact these three different brain systems lust romantic love and deep attachment partner the first women working moving into the work force looked societies through the ographic year book the united nations and every where the world out them women are not only moving into the job market sometimes very very slowly but they are moving into the job market and they are very slowly clos that gap between men and women terms economic power health and education s very for every trend this planet there s counter trend all know them but nevertheless the arabs say the dog may bark but the caravan move and indeed that caravan moving women are moving back into the job market and say back into the job market because this not new for million years the grasslands africa women com work gather their able they came home with percent the even the doub come family was the standard and women were regard just economic social and sexual powerful men short really moving forward the past then women s worst invention was the with the beginning agri culture men s role became extremely powerful women lost their ancient job collect but then with the industrial revolution and the post industrial revolution they moving back into the job market short they are acquir the status that they had million years ago years ago years ago are seeing now one the most remarkable trad ions the history the human animal and s going have impact general give whole lecture the impact women the business community only just say couple things and then sex and love there s lot gender difference body who think men and women are like simply never had boy and girl child don know why that they want think that men and women are like there s much have common but there s whole lot that not have common are the words ted hughes think that were built like two feet need each other get ahead but did not evolve have the same brain and finding more and more and more gender difference the brain only just use couple and then move sex and love one them women s verbal ability women can talk women s ability find the right word rapid basic articul ation goes the middle the menstru cycle when estrogen level peak but even menstru ation they better than the average man women can talk they been doing for million years words were women s tools they held that baby front their face cajol reprim educat with words and indeed they coming very powerful force even place like and japan where women are not moving rapid into the regular job market they moving into journa and think that the tele vision like the global campfire around and shape our mind almost always when the produce who call who negotiat what going say woman fact lzhenitsyn once said have great write have another govern today percent people who are write america are women s one many many characteristic that women have that they will bring into the job market they got incredible people kill negotiat kill they high imagi native now know the brain circuit imagi ation long term planning they tend web think because the female parts the brain are better connected they tend collect more piece data when they think put them into more complex pattern see more options and comes they tend context holistic think what call web think men tend and these are average tend get rid what they regard extra neous focus what they and move more step step thinking pattern they both perfect good way thinking need both them get ahead fact there s many more male genius the world when the and there s also many more male idiots the world when the male brain work well work extremely well and what really think that doing moving toward collaborati society society which the tale both men and women are coming under stood and value and employed but fact women moving into the job market having huge impact sex and romance and family life for most women are starting express their sexual always astonished when people come and say why that men are adulterous and say why you think more men are adulterous than women well men are more adulterous and say who you think these men are sleeping with and basic math anyway the western world women start sex have more partner express less remorse for the partner that they marry later have few children leave bad marriage order get good one are seeing the rise female sexual expression and indeed once again moving forward the kind sexual expression that probably saw the grasslands africa million years ago because this the kind sexual expression that see hunt and gather societies today also turn ancient form marriage quality they now saying that the century going the century what they call the symmetrical marriage the pure marriage the companion marriage this marriage between equals moving forward pattern that high compatible with the ancient human spir also seeing rise romantic love percent american women and percent american men would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for partner they were not love with that person people around the world study societies want love with the person that they marry indeed arranged marriage are their way off this braid human life even think that marriage might even become more table because the second great world trend the first one being women moving into the job market the second one being the aging world population they now saying that america that middle age should regard age because that high age category much percent people have nothing really wrong with them seeing there s real extensi middle age and looked for one book looked divorce data societies and turns out the older you get the less likely you are divorce the divorce rate right now table america and s actually beginning decline may decline some more would even say that with viagra estrogen place hip place ment and the incredibly interesting women women have never been interesting they are now not any time this planet have women been educat interesting capable and honestly think that there really was ever time human evolution when have the opportunity make good marriage that time now ever there s always kinds complicat this these three brain systems lust romantic love and attachment don always together they can together the way that s why casual sex isn casual with orgasm you get spike dopamine dopamine s associated with romantic love and you can just fall love with somebody who you just having casual sex with with orgasm then you get real rush oxytoc and press those are associated with attachment this why you can feel such sense cosmic union with somebody after you made love them but these three brain systems lust romantic love and attachment aren always connected each other you can feel deep attachment long term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else while you feel the sex drive for people relate these other partner short capable loving more than one person time fact you can lie bed night and wing from deep feeling attachment for one person deep feeling romantic love for somebody else s there s committee meeting going your head you are trying decide what don think honestly animal that was built happy are animal that was built produce think the happiness find make and think ever can make good relationship with each other want conclu with two things want conclu with worry have worry and with wonderful story the worry about antidepressants over million prescript antidepressants are written every year the united states and these drugs are going gene they are ping around the world know one girl who s been these antidepressants serotonin enhancing ssri serotonin enhancing antidepressants since she was she s she s been them ever since she was got nothing against people who take them short term when they going through something perfect horrible they want com suicide kill somebody else would recomm but more and more people the united states are taking them long term and indeed what these drugs raise level serotonin and raising level serotonin you suppress the dopamine circuit everybody know that dopamine associated with romantic love not only they suppress the dopamine circuit but they kill the sex drive and when you kill the sex drive you kill orgasm and when you kill orgasm you kill that flood drugs associated with attachment the things are connected the brain and when you tamper with one brain system you going tamper with another just simply saying that world without love dead place now thank you want end with story and then just comment been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for years identical interested why all like why you and are like why the iraq and the japan and the australia aborigines and the people the amaz river are all like and about year ago internet dating service match com came and asked would design new dating site for them said don know anything about personal you know don know you think you got the right person they said yes got thinking about why that you fall love with one person rather than another that s current project will next book there s all kinds reason that you fall love with one person rather than another tim important pro important mystery important you fall love with somebody who s some sterious part because mystery elevates dopamine the brain probably pushes you over that thres fall love you fall love with somebody who fits with what call your love map conscious list traits that you build childhood you grow and also think that you gravitate certain people actually with some com brain systems and that s what now contribut this but want tell you story about rate been carry here about the biology love wanted show you little bit about the culture too the magic s story that was told somebody who had heard just from one the probably true story was graduate student rutgers and two colleagues art sun brook that s where put our people the mri machine and this graduate student was madly love with another graduate student and she was not love with him and they were all conference beijing and knew from our work that you and something very novel with somebody you can drive the dopamine the brain and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love decided put science work and invite this girl off rickshaw ride with him and sure enough never been one but apparent they all around the bus and the truck and s crazy and s noisy and s exciting and figured that this would drive the dopamine and she would fall love with him off they and she s squeal and squeez him and laugh and having wonderful time hour later they get down off the rickshaw and she throw her hands and she says wasn that wonderful and wasn that rickshaw river hands there s magic love but will end saying that million years ago evolved three basic drive the sex drive romantic love and attachment long term partner these circuit are deep embed the human brain they going survive long our species survive what shakespeare called this mortal thank you
