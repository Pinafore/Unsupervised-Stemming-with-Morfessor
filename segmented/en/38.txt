inventor entrepreneur and vision ray kurzweil explain abundant ground detail why the s will have reverse engineered the human brain and nano bots will operating your consciousness biotech business culture future invention robots science technology transhuman ray kurzweil how technology will transform well s great here heard lot about the promise technology and the peril been quite interested both could convert percent the sunlight that fall the earth into energy could meet all our project needs for can that today because solar panel are heavy expensive and very efficient there are nano engineered design which least have been analyzed theoretical that show the potential very light weight very expensive very efficient and able actually provide all our energy needs this renewable way nano engineered fuel cells could provide the energy where s needed that s key trend which central ization moving from central ized nuclear power plants and liquid natural gas tankers central ized resource that are environmentally more friendly lot more efficient and capable and safe from disrupt bono spoke very eloquent that have the tools for the first time address age old problems disease and poverty most region the world are moving that direction east asia and the pacific region there were million people living poverty that number now under million the world bank projects will under million which reduction percent did enjoy bono s comment link haight ashbury silicon valley being from the massachusetts high tech community myself point out that were hippie also the s although hung around harvard square but have the potential over come disease and poverty and going talk about those issues have the will kevin kell talked about the acceleration technology that s been strong interest mine and that developed for some years realized that technologies had make sense when finished project that ably the world was different place when would introduce technology and noticed that most invention fail not because the amp department can get work you look most business plans they will actually succeed given the opportunity build what they say they going build and percent those projects more will fail because the timing wrong not all the enabling factor will place when they needed began ardent student technology trend and track where technology would different point time and began build the mathematical models that s kind taken life own got group people that work with gather data key measure technology many different areas and build models and you hear people say well can predict the future and you ask will the price google higher lower than today three years from now that s very hard say will the wireless standard three years from now that s hard say but you ask what will cost for one computing the cost sequence base pair dna the cost sending megabyte data wireless turns out that those are very predict able there are remark ably smooth exponential curve that govern price performance capacity bandwidth and going show you small sample this but there s really theoretical reason why technology develop exponential fashion and lot people when they think about the future think about linear they think they going continue develop problem address problem using today s tools today s pace progress and fail take into consider ation this exponential growth the genome project was controversial project had our best students our most advanced equipment around the world got the project done how going get this done years and years into the project the skeptic were still going strong says you two third through this project and you managed only sequence very tiny percentage the whole genome but s the nature exponential growth that once reach the knee the curve explod most the project was done the last few years the project took years sequence hiv sequence sars days are gain the potential over come these problems going show you just few examples how vasive this phenomena the actual paradigm shift rate the rate adopt new ideas doubling every decade according our models these are all logarithmic graph you the level represent generally multiply factor took half century adopt the telephone the first virtual reality technology cell phones were adopted about eight years you put different communication technologies this logarithmic graph television radio telephone were adopted decade recent technologies like the the web cell phones were under decade now this interesting chart and this really gets the fundamental reason why evolutionary process and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes accele rate they work through interaction they create capability and then uses that capability bring the next stage the first step biological evolution the evolution dna actually was rna came first took billion years but then evolution used that information process back bone bring the next stage the cambrian explosion when all the body plans the animals were evolved took only million years was times faster and then evolution used those body plans evolve higher cognitive function and biological evolution kept accelerating s inherent nature evolutionary process homo sapiens the first technology creating species the species that combined cognitive function with opposable and the way chimpanzees don really have very good opposable thumb could actually manipulate our environment with power grip and fine motor coordination and use our mental models actually change the world and bring technology but anyway the evolution our species took hundreds thousands years and then working through interaction evolution used essentially the technology creating species bring the next stage which were the first step technological evolution and the first step took tens thousands years stone tools fire the wheel kept accelerating always used then the latest generation technology create the next generation printing press took century adopted the first computers were designed pen paper now use computers and had continual acceleration this process now the way you look this linear graph looks like everything has just happened but some observ says well kurzweil just put point this graph that fall that straight line took different lists from key think like the encyclopedia britannica the museum natural history carl sagan s cosmic calendar the same and these people were not trying make point these were just lists reference works and think that s what they thought the key events were biological evolution and technological evolution and again forms the same straight line you have little bit thick the line because people have disagree ments what the key point are there s difference opinion when agriculture started how long the cambrian explosion took but you see very clear trend there s basic profound acceleration this evolutionary process information technologies double their capacity price performance bandwidth and that s very profound explosion exponential growth personal experience when was mit computer taking about the size this room less powerful than the computer your cell phone but moore s law which very often identified with this exponential growth just one example many because s basically property the evolutionary process technology put famous computers this logarithmic graph the way straight line logarithmic graph exponential growth that s another exponential took three years double our price performance computing two years the middle now doubling every one year and that s exponential growth through five different paradigm moore s law was just the last part that where were shrinking transistor integrated circuit but had electro mechanical calculator based computers that crack the german enigma code vacuum tubes the s predict the election eisenhower discreet transistor used the first space flight and then moore s law every time one paradigm ran out team another paradigm came out left field continue the exponential growth they were shrinking vacuum tubes making them smaller and smaller that hit wall they couldn shrink them and keep the vacuum whole different paradigm transistor came out the wood work fact when see the end the line for particular paradigm create research pressure create the next paradigm and because been predict the end moore s law for quite long time the first prediction said until now says but the teen years the features transistor will few atoms width and won able shrink them any more that the end moore s law but won the end the exponential growth computing because chips are flat live three dimensional world might well use the third dimension will into the third dimension and there s been tremendous progress just the last few years getting three dimensional self organizing molecular circuit work have those ready well before moore s law runs out team super computers same thing process performance chips the average price transistor you could buy one transistor for dollar you could buy million s pretty remarkable how smooth exponential process that mean you think this the result some table experiment but this the result worldwide chaotic behavior countries using each other dump products bank ruptcies marketing program you would think would very atic process and you have very smooth come this chaotic process just can predict what one molecule gas will s hope less predict single molecule yet can predict the properties the whole gas using dynamic very accurate s the same thing here can predict any particular project but the result this whole worldwide chaotic predict able activity competition and the evolutionary process technology very predict able and can predict these trend far into the future unlike gertrude s rose s not the case that transistor transistor make them smaller and less expensive the electro have less distance travel they faster you got exponential growth the speed transistor the cost cycle one transistor has been coming down with halv rate years you add other forms innovation and process design you get doubling price performance computing every one year and that s basically deflation percent deflation and s not just computers mean s true dna sequencing s true brain scanning s true the world wide web mean anything that can quant have hundreds different measure ments different information related measure ments capacity adoption rates and they basically double every months depending what you looking terms price performance that s percent deflation rate and economists have actually started worry about that had deflation during the depression but that was collapse the money supply collapse consumer confidence completely different phenomena this due greater productivity but the economist says but there s way you going able keep with that you have percent deflation people may increase their volume percent but they won keep with but what actually seeing that actually more than keep with had percent per year compound growth dollars information technology over the last years mean people didn build ipod for dollars years ago the price performance makes new application feasible new application come the market and this very wide spread phenomena magnetic data storage that s not moore s law s shrinking magnetic spot different engineers different companies same exponential process key revolution that understanding our own biology these information terms understanding the software program that make our body run these were evolved very different times like actually change those program one little software program called the fat insulin receptor gene basically says hold every calorie because the next hunting season may not work out well that was the interest the species tens thousands years ago like actually turn that program off they tried that animals and these mice ate ravenous and remain slim and got the health benefits being slim they didn get diabetes they didn get heart disease they lived percent longer they got the health benefits caloric restriction without the restriction four five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this felt that would interesting drug for the human market and that s just one the genes that affect our chemistry were evolved era where wasn the interest people the age most people this conference like myself live much longer because were using the precious resource which were better deployed towards the children and those car for them life long lifespan like that say much more than weren elected for but are learning actually manipulate and change these software program through the technology revolution for example can inhibit genes now with rna inter ference there are exciting new forms gene therapy that over come the problem placing the genetic material the right place the chromosome there s actually for the first time now something going human trials that actually cures pulmonary hyper tension fatal disease using gene therapy have not just designer babies but designer baby boom and this technology also accelerating cost dollars per base pair then s now under cent the amount genetic data basically this shows that smooth exponential growth double every year enabling the genome project complete another major revolution the communication revolution the price performance bandwidth capacity communication measured many different ways wired wireless growing exponential the internet has been doubling power and continue measured many different ways this based the number host miniatur ization shrinking the size technology exponential rate both wired and wireless these are some design from drexler s book which now showing are feasible with super computing simulation where actually there are scientists building molecule scale robots one has one that actually walk with surprising human like that s built out molecules there are little machines doing things experimental base the most exciting opportunity actually inside the human body and perform rapeutic and diagnostic function and this less futurist than may sound these things have already been done animals there s one nano engineered device that cures type diabetes s blood cell sized they put tens thousands these the blood cell they tried this rat let insulin out controlled fashion and actually cures type diabetes what you watching design robotic red blood cell and does bring the issue that our biology actually very sub optimal even though s remarkable tricacy once understand principles operation and the pace with which are reverse engineering biology accelerating can actually design these things thousands times more capable analysis this respirocyte designed rob freitas indicate you replace percent your red blood cells with these robotic version you could olympic print for minutes without taking breath you could the bottom your pool for four hours honey the pool will take whole new meaning will interesting see what our olympic trials presumably ban them but then have the spec teenager their high school gym routine out perform the olympic athlete freitas has design for robotic white blood cell these are circa scenarios but they not futurist may sound there are four major conference building blood cell sized device there are many experiment animals there s actually one going into human trial this feasible technology come back our exponential growth computing dollars computing now somewhere between insect and mouse brain will intersect human intelligence terms capacity the s but that the hardware side the equation where will get the software well turns out can see inside the human brain and fact not surprising the spatial and temporal solution brain scanning doubling every year and with the new generation scanning tools for the first time can actually see individual inter neural fiber and see them process and signal real time but then the question can get this data now but can understand doug hofstadter wonder well maybe our intelligence just isn great enough understand our intelligence and were smarter well then our brains would that much more complicated and never catch turns out that can understand this block diagram model and simulation the human auditory cortex that actually works quite well apply psycho acoustic test gets very similar results human auditory perception there s another simulation the cerebellum that s more than half the neurons the brain again works very similar human form ation this early stage but you can show with the exponential growth the amount information about the brain and the exponential improvement the solution brain scanning will succeed reverse engineering the human brain the s already had very good models and simulation about region out the several hundred all this driving exponential growing economic progress had productivity from dollars dollars per hour labor the last years commerce has been growing exponential s now trillion dollars you might wonder well wasn there boom and bust that was strict capital market phenomena wall street noticed that this was evolutionary technology which was but then six months later when hadn revolution ized all business models they figured well that was wrong and then had this bust all right this technology that put together using some the technologies involved this will routine feature cell phone would able translate from one language another let just end with couple scenarios computers will disappear they small they embedded our clothing our environment images will written directly our reti providing full immersion virtual reality augmen real reality interacting with virtual personalities but really have the full these trend and you have appreciate how many turns the screw terms generation technology which are getting faster and faster have that point mean will have two the power greater price performance capacity and bandwidth these technologies which pretty phenomena millions times more powerful than today have complete the reverse engineering the human brain dollars computing will far more powerful than the human brain terms basic raw capacity computers will combine the subtle pan cognition power human intelligence with ways which machines are already superior terms doing analytic thinking remember billion fact accurate machines can share their knowledge very quickly but s not just alien invasion intelligent machines are going merge with our technology these nano bots mentioned will first used for medical and health application clean the environment providing powerful fuel cells and widely distribute central ized solar panel and the environment but they also inside our brain interact with our biological neurons demonstrate the key principles being able this for example full immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system the nano bots shut down the signals coming from your real sense replace them with the signals that your brain would receiv you were the virtual environment and then feel like you that virtual environment you can there with other people have any kind experience with anyone volv all the sense experience call them will put their whole flow sensory experience the neuro logical correlates their emotions out the internet you can plug and experience what s like someone else but most important tremendous expansion human intelligence through this direct merge with our technology which some sense doing already routine intellectual that would impossible without our technology human life expectancy expand was and with this sort technology nano technology revolution this will move very rapidly the years ahead main message that progress technology exponential not linear many even scientists assume linear model they say hundreds years before have self replicating nano technology assembly artificial intelligence you really look the power exponential growth you see that these things are pretty soon hand and information technology increasing encompass all our lives from our music our manufacturing our biology our energy materials able manufacture almost anything need the s from information very expensive raw materials using nano technology these are very powerful technologies they both empower our promise and our peril have have the will apply them the right problems thank you very much
