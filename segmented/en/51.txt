this energiz talk amory lovins lay out his simple plan for the off oil and vital izing the economy macarthur grant business economics energy environment green science technology amory lovins winning the oil endgame the old story about climate protect that s cost would have been done already government needs make something painful fix the new story about climate protect that s not cost but profitable this was simple sign error because s cheaper save fuel than buy fuel well known companies that all the time for example dupont s micro electronic many other firm ibm are reducing their energy intensity routine six percent year fix their plants and they get their money back two three years that s called profit now similar the old story about oil that wanted save very much would expensive would have done already because market are essentially perfect course that were true there would innovation and nobody could make any money but the new story about oil the government doesn have force painful things get off oil not just incremental but completely quite the contrary the united states for example can completely eliminate use oil and rejuvenate the economy the same time led business for profit because s much cheaper save and substitut for the oil than keep buying this process will also catalyzed the military for own reasons combat effective ness and prevent conflict particularly over oil this set out book called winning the oil endgame that four colleagues and wrote and have posted for free endgame com about down loads far and was sponsor the s independent s peer review and all the back calculation are transparent posted for your peru now bit economic history think may help here around one the biggest s industries was whal and whale oil lit practical every building but the nine years before drake struck oil least five sixth that whale oil illumina market disappeared thanks fatal comp etitors chief oil and gas made from coal which the whale had not been paying attention very unexpected they ran out customer before they ran out whale the remnant whale population were saved technological innov ators and profit izing capitalist and s funny feel bit like this now for oil been spend the last few decade accumul ating very powerful back technologies for saving and substitut for oil and one had bothered add them before when did found some very surprising things now there are two big reasons concerned about oil both national competitive ness and national security are risk the competitive ness front all know that toyota has more market cap than the big three put together and serious competition from europe from korea and next china which will soon major net cars how long you think will take before you can drive home your new wal shanghai automotive super efficient car maybe decade according friends detroit china has energy policy based radical energy efficiency and leap frog technology they not going port your uncle s buick and after that comes india the point here these cars are going made super efficient the question who will make them will the united states continue import efficient cars replace foreign oil will make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars that seems make more sense the more keep using the oil particularly the import oil the more face very obvious array problems our analysis assume that they all cost nothing but nothing not the right number could well enough double the oil price for example and one the worst these what does our standing the world other countries think that everything about oil have treat countries that have oil different than countries that don have oil and our military get quite happy with having stand guard pipe lines far off when what they actually signed for was protect american citizens they don like fighting over oil they don like being the and they don like where the oil money goes and what sort stability create now order avoid these problems whatever you think they worth s actually not that complicated can save half the oil using more efficient cost dollars per saved barrel and then can replace the other half with combination advanced bio fuel and safe natural gas and that cost average under dollars barrel and compared with the official forecast that oil will cost dollars barrel which half what been paying lately that will save billion dollars year starting quite soon now order this need invest about billion dollars half tool the car truck and plane industries half build the advanced bio fuel industry the process will gain about million good jobs mainly rural and protect another million jobs now risk mainly auto making and also get return over billion dollars year that s very hand some return s finance able the private capital market but you want for the reasons just mentioned happen sooner and with higher confidence then and also expand choice and manage risk then you might like some light handed public policies that support rather than distort the business logic and these policies work fine without taxes subsidies mandate they make little net money for the treasury they have broad trans ideo logical appeal and because want them actually happen figured out ways them that not require much any federal legisl ation and can indeed done administr ative state level just illustrate what about the nub the problem namely light vehicles here are four ultra light carbon composite concept cars with low drag and all but the one the upper left have hybrid drive you can sort have all with these things for example this opel two seat does miles hour miles gallon this muscle car from toyota horse power ultra light that does zero well under four seconds and still gets miles gallon say more later about this and the upper left pioneer effort years ago miles gallon without even using hybrid four seat well saving that fuel percent the fuel light vehicles cost about cents per saved gallon but s even better deal for heavy trucks where you save similar amount cents gallon with better aero dynamic and tires and engine and and taking out weight you can put into load you can double efficiency with percent internal rate return then you can even further almost trip ling efficiency with some operational improvement double the big haul margin and tend use those number create demand pull and flip the market the airplane business s again similar story where the first percent fuel saving free boeing now demo rating new dream but then the next generation planes save about half again much cheaper than buying the fuel and you over the next years blended wing body kind flying wing with internal engine then you get about factor three efficiency improvement able lower cost let focus minute the light vehicles the cars and light trucks because all know the most about those and yet may not realize that standard all the fuel energy you feed into the car seven eighth never gets the wheels s lost first the engine ling zero miles gallon the power train and access ories then the energy that does get the wheels only eighth half that goes heat the tires the road heat the air the car pushes side and only this little bit only six percent actually end accelerating the car and then heat the brakes when you stop fact since percent the weight you moving the car not the driver less than one percent the fuel energy end moving the driver after more than century devoted engineering effort more over three fourth the fuel use caused the weight the car and s obvious from the diagram that every unit energy you save the wheels going avoid another seven units energy getting that energy the wheels there s huge leverage for making the car lot light and the reason this has not been very seriously exam before there was common assumption the industry that well then might not safe you got whack heavy car and would cost lot more make because the only way know how make cars much light was use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium but these object ions are now vanish through advance materials for example use lot carbon fiber composite port good and turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety here s hand made mclaren slr carbon car that got bone golf the golf was total the mclaren just off and scratch the side panel they pop back and fix the scratch later but this mclaren were run into wall miles hour the entire crash energy would absorb couple oven carbon fiber composite total pounds hidden the front end because these materials could actually absorb six times much energy per pound steel and lot more smooth and this means just crack the drum safety and weight could make cars bigger which protect but make them light where made them heavy they both hostile and efficient and when you make them light the right way that can simpler and cheaper make you can end saving money and lives and oil all the same time showed here two years ago little bit about design your basic compromise quintupled efficiency suburban assault vehicle and this complete virtual design that production cost ufactur able and the process needed make actually coming toward the market quite nice figured out kind digital printer for this very stiff strong carbon composite material and then ways form because s combination carbon and nylon into whatever complex shapes you want like the one just shown the auto show one the one pliers and the manufacturing you can this way gets radical simpl ified because the auto body has only say parts instead each one formed one fairly cheap die set instead four expensive ones for stamp steel each the parts can easily lifted with hoist they snap together like kid s you got rid the body shop and you want you can lay color the and get rid the paint shop those are the two hardest and cost parts making car you end with least two fifth lower capital intensity than the lean plant the industry which has lan the plant also gets smaller now when you through similar analysis for every way use oil including buildings industry feed stock and you find that the million barrel day the government says will need well about eight that can moved efficiency then with another seven still being saved the vehicle stock turn over average cost only bucks barrel instead for buying the oil and then another six can made robust competitive from cell ulosic ethanol and little bio diesel without interfering all with the water land needs crop production there huge amount gas saved about half the project gas about eighth price and here are some brain substitut ions with lots left over much fact that after you handle the domestic oil forecast from areas already approved you have only this little bit left and let s see how can meet that because there s pretty flexible menu ways could course buy more efficiency maybe you ought buy efficiency bucks instead wait capture the second half could course just get this little bit continuing import some canadian and mexi oil the ethanol the brazil would love sell but they sell japan and china instead because have tariff barrier protect our corn farmers and they don could use the saved gas directly cover all this balance used hydrogen which more profitable and efficient get rid the domestic oil too and that doesn even count for example that available land the dakotas can cost effectively make enough wind power run every highway vehicle the country have lots options and the choice menu and timing quite flexible now make this happen quick and with higher confidence there few ways government could help for example fee combination fee and rebate any size class vehicle you want can increase the price efficient vehicles and responding pay you rebate for efficient vehicles you not paid change size class you are paid pick efficiency within size class way equivalent looking all four teen years life cycle fuel saving rather than just the first two three this expand choice rapidly the market and actually makes more money for auto makers well like deal with the lack afford able personal mobility this country making very cheaply possible for low income families get efficient reliable new cars that they could otherwise never get and for each car finance crap almost one clunker prefer ably the dirt iest ones this create new million car year market for detroit from customer they weren going get otherwise because they weren credit worthy and could never afford new car and detroit will make money every unit turns out that say african american and white household had the same car ownership would cut employ ment about half providing better access job opportunities this huge social win too government buy hundreds thousands cars year there are smart ways buy them and aggregate that chasing power bring very efficient vehicles into the market faster and could even prize style gold carrot that s worth stretch further for for example billion dollar prize for the first s auto maker sell really advanced vehicles like some you saw earlier then the legacy airline can afford buy the efficient new planes they desperate need cut their fuel bill but you felt philosophical you wanted anything about that there are ways finance and the same time crap efficient old planes that they were otherwise come back the air they would waste more oil and block the take efficient new planes those part efficient planes are worth more society dead than alive ought take them out back and shoot them and put bounty hunters after them then there s important military role that creating the move high volume low cost commercial production these kinds materials for that matter ultra light steel that are good back technology the military can the trick did turning darpa into the internet just turn over the private sector and have internet the same for gps the same for the modern semi conduc industry that military science and technology that they need can create the advanced materials industrial cluster that transform civilian economy and gets the country off oil which would huge contribution eliminating conflict over oil and advanc national and global security then need tool the car industry and training and shift the convergence the energy and value chain shift faster from rocarbons rates and get out our own way other ways and make the transition more efficient vehicles faster but here s how the whole thing fits together instead official forecast oil use and oil import going ever they can turn down with the dollars barrel efficiency down steep adding the supply side substitut ions bucks all implemented slow rates than done before when paid attention and start adding tranches hydrogen there are rapidly off import and completely off oil the s and the one thing like point out here that done this before this eight year period when last paid attention the economy grew percent oil use fell percent oil import fell percent oil import from the persian gulf fell percent they would have been gone kept that one more year well that was with very old technologies and deliver methods could that play lot better now and yet what prove then the s has more market power than opec our the demand side are the saudi arab nega barrel can use less oil faster than they can convenient sell less oil whatever your reason for want this whether you concerned about national security price volatil jobs the planet your grand kids seems that this oil endgame that should all playing win please down load your copy and thank you very much
