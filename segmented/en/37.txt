jimmy wales call how assemble band volunteers gave them tools for collabo rating and created wikipedia the self organizing self correct never finished online encyclopedia business collaboration culture invention media open source technology wikipedia jimmy wales the birth wikipedia charles van who was later senior editor britannica said the deal encyclopedia should radical should stop being safe but you know anything about the history britannica since was anything but radical still very completely safe stodgy type encyclopedia wikipedia the other hand begins with very radical idea and that s for all imagine world which every single person the planet given free access the sum all human knowledge and that s what doing wikipedia you just saw the little demonstration s freely license encyclopedia s written thousands volunteers all over the world many many languages s written using wiki software which the type software just demonstrate anyone can quickly ed and save and goes live the internet immediately and everything about wikipedia managed virtually all volunteer staff when yochai talking about new methods organization s exactly describing wikipedia and what going today tell you little bit more about how really works the inside wikipedia s owned the wiki media foundation which founded nonprofit organization and our goal the core aim the wiki media foundation get free encyclopedia every single person the planet and you think about what that means means lot more than just building cool website really interested all the issues the digital divide poverty worldwide empower people everywhere have the information that they need make good decisions and going have lot work that goes beyond just the internet and that s big part why chose the free licensing model because that empower local entrepreneur anyone who want can take our content and anything they like with you can copy distribute and you can commercial non commercial there s lot opportunities that are going arise around wikipedia all over the world funded ations from the public and one the more interesting things about that how little money actually takes run wikipedia yochai showed you the graph what the cost printing press was and going tell you what the cost wikipedia but first show you how big got over articles english got two million total articles across many many different languages the biggest languages are german japanese french all the western european languages are quite big but only around one third all our traffic our web cluster the english wikipedia which surprising lot people lot people think very english centric way the internet but for truly global many many languages how popular gotten top website and more popular than the new york times this where get yochai s discussion this shows the growth wikipedia the blue line there and then this the new york times over there and what s interesting about this the new york times website huge enormous corporate operation with have idea how many hundreds employee have exactly one employee and that employee our lead software developer and s only been our employee since january all the other growth before that the servers are managed rag tag band volunteers all the ed done volunteers and the way that organized not like any traditional organization you can imagine people are always asking well who s charge this who does that and the answer anybody who want pitch s very unusual and chaotic thing got over servers now three location these are managed volunteer system administrator who are online can online any time the day night and see eight people waiting for ask question something anything about the servers you could never afford this company you could never afford have stand crew people hours day and what doing wikipedia doing around billion page view month s really gotten huge thing and everything managed the volunteers and the total month cost for our bandwidth about dollars and that s essentially our main cost could actually without the employee actually hired brian because was working part time for two years and full time wikipedia actually hired him could get life and the movie sometimes the big question when you got this really chaotic organization why isn all rubbish why the website good first all how good well s pretty good isn perfect but s much much better than you would expect given our completely chaotic model when you saw him make ridiculous ed the page about you think this obviously just going generate into rubbish but when seen quality test and there haven been enough these yet and really encouraging people more wikipedia traditional things win hands down german magazine compared german wikipedia which really much much smaller than english microsoft encarta and brockhaus multi media and won across the board they hired experts come and look articles and compare the quality and were very please with that result lot people have heard about the wikipedia bush kerry controversy the media has covered this some what extensive started out with article red ring the report called and they mean have say they spell name right but they really wanted say the bush kerry election contentious s tear apart the wikipedia community and they quote saying they the most contentious the history wikipedia what actually said they not contentious all s light quote the articles were ed quite heavily and true that did have lock the articles couple occasion time magazine recently reported that extreme action sometimes has taken and wales locked the entries kerry and bush for most this came after told the report that had lock for occasion ally little bit here and there the truth general that the kinds controversies that you would probably think have within the wikipedia community are not really controversies all articles controversial topic are ed lot but they don cause much controversy within the community and the reason for this that most people understand the need for neutrality the real struggle not between the right and the left that s where most people assume but s between the party the thought and the party the jerks and side the political spectrum has monopoly either those qualities the actual truth about the specific bush kerry incident that the bush kerry articles were locked less than one percent the time and wasn because they were contentious was just because there was routine vandalism which happens sometimes even stage people sometimes even report have reported that they vandalize wikipedia and were amazed that was fix quickly and said you know always say please don that that s not good thing how this how manage the quality control how does work there s few element mostly social policies and some element the software the biggest and the most important thing our neutral point view policy this something that set down from the very beginning core principle the community that s completely not debat able s social concept operation don talk lot about truth and object ivity the reason for this say only going write the truth about some topic that doesn damn bit good figuring out what write because don agree with you about what s the truth but have this term neutrality which has own long history within the community which basically says any time there s controversial issue wikipedia itself should not take stand the issue should merely report what able parties have said about this neutrality policy really important for because empower community that very diverse come together and actually get some work done have very diverse contributors terms political religious cultural background having this firm neutrality policy which non negoti able from the beginning ensure that people can work together and that the entries don become simply war back and forth between the left and the right you engage that type behavior you asked leave the community real time peer review every single change the site goes the recent changes page soon made his change went the recent changes page that recent changes page was also fed into irc channel which internet chat channel that people are monitor with various software tools and people can get feed they can get mail ations changes and then users can set their own personal watch list page quite few volunteers watch lists because sometimes vandalize and therefore what happens someone will notice the change very quickly and then they just simply revert the change there s new pages feed for example you can certain page wikipedia and see every new page s created this really important because lot new pages that get created are just garbage that have deleted you know asdfasdf but also that s some the most interesting and fun things wikipedia some the new articles people will start article some interesting topic other people will find that intriguing and jump and help and make much better have ed anonymous users which one the most controversial and intriguing things about wikipedia chris was able his change didn have log anything just went the website and made change but turns out that only about percent all the ed the website are done anonymous users and that s really important thing understand that the vast majority the ed that the website are from very close knit community maybe people who are constant communication and have over irc channel mail lists all these people know each other they communicate have line meeting these are the people who are doing the bulk the site and they are sense semi professionals what they doing that the standards set for ourselves are equal higher than profession standards quality don always meet those standards but that s what striving for and that tight community who really care for the site and these are some the smart people ever met course s job say that but s actually true the type people who were drawn writing encyclopedia for fun tend pretty smart people the tools and the software there s lots tools that allow allow meaning the community self monitor and monitor all the work this example page history flat earth and you can see some changes that were made what s nice about this page you can immediately take look this and see understand now when somebody goes and looks they see that someone anonymous number made ed page that sounds suspicious who this person somebody looks they can immediately see high light red all the changes that took place see well these words have changed things like this that s one tool that can use very quickly monitor the history page another thing that within the community leave everything very open ended most the social rules and the methods work are left completely open ended the software all that stuff just wiki pages and there s nothing the software that forces the rules the example got here vote for deletion page mentioned earlier people type asdfasdf needs deleted case like that the administrator just delete there s reason have big argument about but you can imagine there s lot other areas where the question this able enough encyclopedia the information verifiable hoax true what needed social method for figuring out the answer this and the method that arose organic ally within the community the vote for deletion page and the particular example have here s film twist issues and the first person says now this supposed film fail the google test miserably the google test you look google and see s there because something s not even google probably doesn exist all s not perfect rule but s nice starting point for quick research somebody says delete please delete s not able and then somebody says wait wait wait wait found found book film threat video guide the under ground film you must see the next person says clean somebody says found imdb keep keep keep and what s interesting about this that the software these vote are just they just text type into page this not really vote much dialogue now true that the end the day administrator can through here and take look this and say delete two keep delete but other case this could delete and two keep and would keep because those last two keep say wait minute wait minute nobody else saw this but found book and found link page that describe and going clean tomorrow please don delete then would survive and also matter who the people are who are voting like say s tight knit community down here the bottom keep real movie rick kay rick kay very famous wikipedia who does enormous amount work with vandalism hoax and vote for deletion his voice carrie lot weight within the community because know what s doing how s all this govern people really want know about administrator things like that the wikipedia governance model the governance the community very confusing but work able mix consensus meaning try not vote the content articles because the majority view not necessarily neutral some amount democracy all the administrator these are the people who have the ability delete pages that doesn mean that they have the right delete pages they still have follow all the rules but they elected they elected the community sometimes people random roll the internet like hand pick the administrator bias the content the encyclopedia always laugh this because have idea how they elected actually there s certain amount aristocracy and you got hint that when mentioned like rick kay s voice would carry lot more weight than someone don know give this talk sometimes with angela who was just elected the board from the community the board the foundation with more than twice the vote the person who didn make and always embarrass her because say well angela for example could get away with doing absolutely anything within wikipedia because she s admired and powerful but the irony course that angela can this because she s the one person who you know would never ever ever break any rules wikipedia and also like say she s the only person who actually know all the rules wikipedia and then there s monarchy and that s role the community was describing this once and the next day the newspaper the head line said the queen england and that s not exactly what said but the point role the community within the free software world there s been long standing tradition the benevolent dictator model you look most the major free software projects they have one single person charge who everyone agree the benevolent dictator well don like the term benevolent dictator and don think that s job role the world ideas the dictator the future all human knowledge pile the world just isn appropriate but there need still for certain amount monarchy certain amount sometimes have make decision and don want get bogged down too heavily form decision making processes example why this has been how this can important recently had situation where neo nazi website discovered wikipedia and they said well this horrible this jewish conspiracy website and going get certain articles deleted that don like and see they have voting process going send have member and going send them over and they all going vote and get these pages deleted well they managed get people show that s neo nazi math for you they always think they got member when they got but they managed get people come and vote fairly absurd way delete perfectly valid article course the vote ended being about there was real danger our democratic processes the other hand people said but what are going mean this could happen and what some group gets really seriously organized and comes and want vote then said well fuck just change the rules that s job the community say won allow our open ness and freedom under mine the quality the content and long people trust role then that s valid place for course because the free licensing bad job the volunteers are more than happy take and leave can tell anyone what the final point here that understand how wikipedia works s important understand that our wiki model the way work but are not fanatic web anarchists fact very flexible about the social method ology because s ultimately the passion the community for the quality the work not necessarily for the process that use generate thank you ben saunders yeah ben saunders jimmy you mentioned partial being key wikipedia s success strikes that much the textbook that are used educate our children are inherent bias have you found wikipedia being used teachers and how you see wikipedia changing education jimmy wales yeah lot teachers are beginning use wikipedia there s media story line about wikipedia which think false build the story line blogger versus newspaper and the story line there s this crazy thing wikipedia but academic hate and teachers hate and that turns out not true the last time got mail from journalist saying why academic hate wikipedia sent from harvard email address because was recently appointed fellow there and said well they don all hate but think there s going huge impact and actually have project that personally really excited about which the wiki books project which effort create textbook all the languages and that s much bigger project s going take years come fruit but part that fulfill our mission giving encyclopedia every single person the planet don mean going spam them with style mean going give them tool that they can use and for lot people the world give you encyclopedia that s written university level doesn you any good without whole host literacy materials build you the point where you can actually use and the wiki books project effort that and think that going really see huge may not even come from there s all kinds innovation going but freely license textbook are the next big thing education
