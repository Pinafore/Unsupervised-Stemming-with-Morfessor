architect joshua prince ramus takes the audience dazzl dizzy virtual tour three recent projects the central library seattle the museum plaza louisville and the charles theater dallas architecture arts collaboration culture design library joshua prince ramus seattle s library going present three projects rapid fire don have much time and want force three ideas with that rapid fire presentation the first what like call hyper rational process s process that takes rational almost absurd level and trans all the gage that normally comes with what people would call sort rational conclusion something and conclude something that you see here that you actually wouldn expect being the result rational the second the second that this process does not have signature there author ship architects are obsessed with author ship this something that has ed and has team fact longer see within this process the traditional master architect creating sketch that his ions carry out and the third that challenge and this the length this very hard support why connect all these things but challenge the high modernist notion flexibility high modernist said will create sort singular space that are generic almost anything can happen within them call sort shot flexibility turn your head this way shoot and you bound kill something this the promise high modern within single space actually any kind activity can happen but seeing operational cost are starting dwarf capital cost terms design meters and with this sort idea what happens whatever actually the building open day whatever seems the most immediate need starts dwarf the possibility and sort anything else could ever happen and proposing different kind flexibility something that call compartment ized flexibility and the idea that you within that continuum identify series point and you design specifically them they can pushed off center little bit but the end you actually still get much that original spectrum you originally had hope with high modernist flexibility that doesn really work now going talk about going build the seattle central library this way before your eyes about five six diagram and truly mean this the design process that you see with the library staff and the library board settle two core position this the first one and this showing over the last years the evolution the book and other technologies this diagram was our sort position piece about the book and our position was books are technology that s something people but s form technology that will have share domi with any other form truly potent technology media the second premise and this was something that was very difficult for convince the librarians first that libraries since the inception library tradition america had second responsibility and that was for social role now this come back later but something actually the librarians first said this isn our mandate our mandate media and particularly the book what you seeing now actually the design the building the upper diagram what had seen whole host contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility sort any activity could happen anywhere don know the future the library don know the future the book and use this approach and what saw were buildings that were very generic and worse not only did see buildings that were very generic not only does the reading room look like the copy room look like the magazine area but meant that whatever issue was troubling the library that moment was starting engulf every other activity that was happening and this case what was getting engulf were these social responsibilities the expansion the book and proposed what s the lower diagram very dumb approach simply compartment put those things whose evolution could predict and don mean that could say whatever would actually happen the future but have some certainty the spectrum whatever would happen the future put those boxes designed specifically for and put the things that can predict the roof that was the core idea now had convince the library that social role was equally important media order get them accept this what you seeing here actually their program the left that s was given all clar and glory our first operation was digest back them show them and say you know what haven touched but only one third your own program dedicated media and books two third already dedicated that s the white band below the thing you said isn important already dedicated social function once had presented that back them they agreed that this sort core concept could work got the right back first principles that s the third diagram combined everything and then started making new decisions what you seeing the right the design the library specifically terms square foot the left that diagram here you see series five platform sort collect program and the right are the more terminate space things like reading room whose evolution years can predict that literally was the design the building they signed and their chagr came back week later and presented them this and you can see literally the diagram the right just sized really mean that literally the things the the left hand side the diagram those are the boxes sized them into five compartment they super efficient had very low budget work with pushed them around the site make very literal contextual relationship the reading room should able see the water the main trance should have public plaza front abide the zoning code and forth you see the five platform those are the boxes within each one very discrete thing happening the area between sort urban continuum these things that can predict their evolution the same degree give you some sense the power this idea the biggest block what call the book spiral s literally built very expensive way parking garage for books just happens the sixth through floor the building but that not necessarily expensive approach and allows organize the entire dewey decimal system one continuous run matter how grow contract within the building will always have clar end the sort trail tear that all experience public libraries and this was the final operation which was take these block they were all pushed off kilter and hold them with skin that skin serve double duty again for economics one the later stability for the entire building structural element but dimension were designed not only for structure but also for holding every piece glass the glass was then just use the word impregnated but had layer metal that was called stress metal that metal acts micro louver from the exterior the building the sun see totally opaque but from the interior s entirely transparent now going take you tour the building let s see can find for anyone who gets motion sick ness apologize this the building and think what s important when first unveiled the building the public thought saw being totally about our and ego and was defend believe not the librarians they said look don know what but know s everything that need based the observation that done about the program this going into one the entries s unusual building for public library obviously now going into what call the reading room sorry living room this actually program that invented with the library was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige public free space there are plenty shopping that allow you get out the rain downtown seattle but there are not many free places that allow you get out the rain this was programmed area where people could pretty much anything including eat yell play che and forth now moving into what call the mixing chamber that was the main sort technology area the building you have tell going too fast for you now this actually the place that put into the building could propose wife right there she said yes running out time actually going stop can show this you later but let s see can very quickly get into the book spiral because think s said the most this the main reading room the most unique part the building you dizzy yet here this the book spiral s very discernible but s actually continuous stair step ping allows you one city block one full floor that s continuum now going back and going hit second project going very very quickly through this now this the dallas theater was unusual client for because they came and they said need you new building been working temporary space for years but because that temporary space become famous theater company theater really focused new york chicago and seattle with the exception the dallas theater company and the very fact that they worked provisional space meant that for beckett they could blow out wall they could cherry orchard and blow hole through the floor and forth was very daunting task for brand new building that could keep the pristine building but keep this kind experimental nature and the second they were what call multi form theater they different kinds performance repertory they the morning will something aren then they something proscenium and forth and they needed able quickly transform between different theater organization and for operational budget reasons this actually longer happens pretty much any multi form theater the united states needed figure out way over come that our thought was literally put the theater head take those things that were previous defined front house and back house and stack them above house and below house and create sort what started call theater machine invest the money the operation the building s almost though the building could placed anywhere wherever you place the area underneath charged for rical performance and allowed back first principles and redefine fly tower acoustic enclosure light enclosure and forth and the push button allows the artistic director move between proscenium thrust and fact aren and traverse and flat floor very quick trans figur ation fact can using operational budget can sorry capital cost can actually achieve what was longer achievable operational cost and that means that the artistic director now has palette that she can choose from between series forms and series process ions because that enclosure around the theater that normally trapped with front house and back house space has been liber ated artistic director has the ability show have performance that enter wagnerian process shows the first act thrust the inter mission greek process second act aren and forth going show you what this actually means this the theater close any portion around the theater actually can opened discrete the light enclosure can lifted separate the acoustic enclosure you can beckett with dallas the back drop portion can opened you can now actually have motorcycle drive directly into the performance you can even just have open air performance for inter mission the balconies all move between those figur ations but they also disappear the proscenium line can also disappear you can bring enormous objects fact their the dallas theater company their first show will play about charles lindbergh and they want bring real aircraft and then also provide them the off season the ability actually rent out their space for entirely different things this night sorry from distance open entire portion for different kinds events and night again move the light enclosure keep the acoustic enclosure this monster truck show going show now the last project this also unusual client they verted the whole idea development they came and they said unlike normal developer they said want start out providing contemporary art museum louisville that s our main goal and instead being developer that see opportunity make money they saw ability catalyst their downtown and the fact that they wanted support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro form they worked reverse and that pro form led mix use building that was very large order support their aspir ations the art but also opened opportunities for the art itself collaborate interact with commercial space that actually artists more and more want work within and also charged with thinking about how have something that was both single building and credible sort sub building now going this louisville s line and going take you through various constraints that led the project first the physical constraints actually had operate three discrete sites all them well well smaller than the size the building had operate next the new muhammad center and respect had operate within the year flood plain now this area flood three four times year and there s levee behind our site similar the ones that broke new orleans have operate behind the corridor street that cut through the middle these separate sites these starting build sort nightmare constraints bathtub underneath the bathtub are the city s main power lines and there pedestrian corridor that they wanted add that would link series cultural buildings and view corridor because this the historic district that they didn want obstruct with the new building and now going add million square feet and did the traditional thing that million square feet these are the different program the traditional thing would identify the public element place them sites and now have really terrible situation public thing the middle bathtub that flood and then would size all the other element the different commercial element hotel housing office and forth and dump top and would create something that was viable fact and you know this this called the time building our strategy was very simple just lift the entire block flip some the element over position them they have appropriate view and relationship downtown and make circulation connection and route the road that s the basic concept and now going show you what leads seems very form will gesture but something derived entirely out the constraints and again when unveiled there was sort nervous ness that this was about architect making statement not architect who was attempt solve series problems now within that center zone said have the ability mix series things here you can see that these this sort ray the towers are totally developer driven they told the dimension the size and forth and focused taking all the public components the lobbies the bars everything that the different commercial element would have and combined the center the sort map the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum create situation like this where you have artists who can operate within art space that also has amazing view the floor but also has proximity that the curator can either open close allows people exercise bicycle seen see the art and forth also means that artist want invade something like swimming pool they can begin their exhibit swimming pool they not forced always work within the confines contemporary gallery space how build this s very simple s chair begin building the cores building the cores build the contemporary art museum grade that allows have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency this not high budget building the moment the cores get mid level finish the art museum put all the mechanical equipment and then jack into the air this how they build really large aircraft hang for instance the ones that they did for the finish the cores finish the and you get something that looks like this now only have about seconds want start animation and conclude with that thank you chris asked add the theater under construction and this project will start construction about year and finish
