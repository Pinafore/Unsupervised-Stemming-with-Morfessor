rice university professor richard baraniuk explain the vision behind connexions his open source online education system cut out the textbook allow teachers share and modify course materials freely anywhere the world business collaboration culture education global issues library open source technology web richard baraniuk open source learning rich baraniuk and what like talk little bit about today are some ideas that think have just tremendous resonance with all the things that have been talked about the last two days fact many different point resonance that s going difficult bring them all but try best does anybody remember these these are records and they been replace right they been wept away over the last two decade these types world flatten digitiz ation technologies right and think was best witnessed when thomas was playing the music came the room today what s happened the music world there s culture ecosystem that s been created that you take some words from apple the catch phrase that create rip mix and burn what mean that that anyone the world free and allowed create new music and musical ideas anyone the world allowed rip copy musical ideas use them innovative ways anyone allowed mix them different types ways draw connection between musical ideas and people can burn them create final products and continue the circle and what that s done s created like said vibr community that s very inclusive with people continual working connect musical ideas innovate them and keep things constantly date today s hit single not last year s hit single but not here talk about music today here talk about books particular textbook and the kind educational materials that use every day school has anyone here ever been school does anybody realize there s crisis our school around the world not going spend too much time that but what want talk about some the connect that appear when author publish book that fact the publishing process just because the fact that s complicated s heavy books are expensive create sort wall between author books and the ultimate users books they teachers students just general reader and this even more true you happen speak language other than one the world s major languages and especially english and going call these people below the barrier shut out because they really shut out the process being able share their knowledge with the world and what want talk about today trying take these ideas that seen the musical culture and try bring these towards inventing the way think about writing books using them and teaching from them that s what like talk about and really how get from where are now where need the first thing like you little thought experiment imagine taking all the world s books everybody imagine books and imagine just tear out the pages liberating these pages and imagine digitiz them and then ring them vast interconnect global repository think massive for book type content and then take that material and imagine making all open that people can modify play with improve imagine making free that anyone the world can have access all this knowledge and imagine using information technology that you can date this content improve play with time scale that s more the order seconds instead years instead ed ions coming out every two years book imagine coming out every seconds imagine could that and imagine could put people into this that could truly build ecosystem with not just author but all the people who could want author all the different languages the world and think you could this would called well just going refer knowledge ecosystem really this the dream and sense what you can think are trying enable anyone the world mean anyone the world their own educational creating educational materials sharing them with the world constantly innov ating them this the dream fact this dream actually being realized over the last six and half years been working really hard rice university project called connexions and what like for the rest the talk just tell you little bit about what people are doing with connexions which you can kind think the counter point nicholas negroponte s talk yesterday where they working the hardware bringing education the world working the open source tools and the content that s sort put perspective here create what are some the people that are using these kind tools well the first thing there s community engineering professors from cambridge kyoto who are developing engineering content electrical engineering develop what you can think massive super textbook that cover the entire area electrical engineering and not only that can customized for use each their own individual institution people like kitty jones right shut out private music teacher and mom from champagne illino who wanted share her fantastic music content with the world how teach kids how play music her material now used over times per month tremendous tremendous use fact lot this use coming from unit states through school because anyone who s involved school scale back the first thing that s cut the music curriculum and this just indic ating the tremendous thirst for this kind open free content lot teachers are using this stuff what about ping what about copy using right team volunteers the university texas graduate students translating this engineering super textbook ideas and within about week having this some our most popular material wide spread use all over latin america and particular mexico because the open extensible nature this people volunteers and even companies that are translating material into asian languages like chinese japanese and thai spread the knowledge even further what about people who are mixing what does mixing mean mixing means building customized course means building customized books companies like national instrument who are embedding very powerful interactive simulation into the materials that can way beyond our regular kind textbook experience that all the teaching materials are things you can actually interact with and play around with and actually learn you been working with teachers without borders who are very interested mixing our materials they going using connexions their platform develop and deliver teaching materials for teaching teachers how teach countries that are around the world twb currently iraq training teachers support and them this idea being able and custom the local context extraordinarily important because just providing free content people has actually been like people the developing world kind cultural imperialism that you don empower people with the ability contextual the material translate into their own language and take ownership s not good other organization been working with merced people know about merced s new university california the central valley working very close with community college they actually developing lot their science and engineering curriculum spread widely around the world our system and they also trying develop all their software tools completely open source been working with which has project called which trying bring internet connect ivity percent the world s population going providing content them whole range different languages and also been working with number other organization particular bunch the projects that are funded hewlett foundation who have taken real leadership role this area open content burn think this sort quite interesting burn the idea trying create the physical instant ation one these course and think lot you received think all you received one these music books your gift pack little present for you just tell you quickly about this engineering textbook s about pages long hard bound this cost anybody guess how much would cost book store audience dollars richard baraniuk this cost dollars the student why does cost dollars because s published demand and s developed from this repository open materials this book were published regular publish would cost least dollars what seeing moving this burning public ation process from the regular sort single author book towards community author materials that are modul that are customized each individual class and published demand very expensive either pushed out through amazon published directly through demand press like coop and think that this extraordinarily interesting area because there tremendous area under this long tail publishing not talking about the harry potter end right the left side talking about books hyper metric partial different equation right books that might sell copies year copies year there tremendous sustain revenue under this long tail sustain open projects like our but also sustain this new emergence demand publish like coop who produced these two books and think one the things that you should take away from this talk that there s impending cut out the middle man inter mediation that s going happening the publishing industry and s going reach crescendo over the next few years and think that s for our benefit really and for the world s benefit what are the enable what s really making all this happen there s tons technology and the only piece technology that really want talk about xml how many people know about xml great s the future the web right s semantic representation comment content and what you can really think xml this case s the pack aging that putting around these pages remember took the book the pages out well what the xml going s going turn those pages into lego block xml are the nub the lego that allow combine the content together riad different ways and provide frame work share content let you take this ecosystem primordial state right all this content all the pages you out books and create highly sophisticated learning machines books course course pack gives you the ability personal the learning experience each individual student that every student can have book course that s customized their learning style their context their language and the things that excite them let you the same materials multiple different ways and surprising new ways let you interconnect ideas indic ating how fields relate each other and just give you personal story came with this six and half years ago because teach the stuff the red box and day job chris said electrical engineering professor teach signal process and challenge was show that this math wow about half you have already fall sleep just looking the equation but this seemingly dry math actually the center this tremendous powerful web that links technology that links really cool application like music synthesize tremendous economic opportunities but also govern intellectual property and the thing that realized there was way that engineer could write this book that would get all this across needed community and needed new tools able interconnect these ideas and think that really sense what trying make s dream come reality where you can imagine all the books library actually starting talk each other and people who are teachers out here ever taught you know this s the interconnect ions between ideas that teaching really all about back math imagine this possible that every single equation that you click one your new text something that you going able explore and experiment with imagine your kid s algebra textbook seven grade you can click every single equation and bring little tool able experiment with tinker with understand because really don understand until the same type mark like math for chemistry imagine chemistry textbook that actually understand the structure how molecules are formed imagine music xml that actually let you into the semantic structure music play with understand s wonder that everybody s getting into right even the three wise men the second big enable and this where told big lie the second big enable intellectual property because fact got here and talked about how great the music culture can share and rip mix and burn but fact that s all illegal and would used rates for doing that because this music has been propert ized s now owned right much big industries really the key thing here can let this happen can let this napster thing happen here what have get right from the very beginning and what have find intellectual property frame work that makes sharing safe and makes easily understand able and the inspiration here taken from open source software things like linux and the gpl and the ideas the creative common license how many people have heard creative common you have not you must learn about creative common org the bottom every piece material connexions and lots other projects you can find their logo click that logo takes you absolute nonsense human read able document that tells you exactly what you can with this content fact you free share all these things copy change even make commercial use long you tribute the author because academic publishing and much educational publishing s really this idea sharing knowledge and making impact that s why people write not necessarily making bucks not talking about harry potter right the long tail end here behind that the legal code you want very carefully construct and creative common taking off over million things out there license with creative common license not just text but music images video and there s actually tremendous take the number people that are actually licensing music make free for people who this whole idea ampl rip mixing burning and sharing like conclude with just the last few point built this idea common people are using get over unique visit per month just our particular site mit open course which another large open content site gets similar number hits but how protect this how protect into the future and the first thing that people are probably thinking quality control right because saying that anybody can contribute things this common anybody can contribute anything that could problem didn take long until people started contributing materials for example lingerie which actually pretty good modul the only problem s plagiar ized from major french feminist journal and when you the supposed course website point lingerie selling website this little bit problem clearly need some kind idea quality control and this really where the idea review and peer review comes you come ted why you come ted because chris and his team have ensure that things are very very high quality right and need able the same thing and need able design structure and what doing designing social software enable anyone build their own peer review process and call these things lenses and basically what they allow anyone out there develop their own peer review process that they can focus the content the repository that they think really important and you can think ted potential lens just like end saying you can really view this call action connexions and open content all about sharing knowledge all you here are tremendous imbued with tremendous amount knowledge and what like invite each and every one you contribute this project and other projects type because think together can truly change the landscape education and educational publishing thanks very much
