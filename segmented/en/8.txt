this emotion charg conversation with journa kurt ersen designer david rockwell discuss the process building view platform ground zero short after new york architecture art cities collaborati culture death design disaster reli inter memory urban planning david rockwell build ground zero kurt ersen like many architect david hog for the lim light but sufficient reticent least tend that asked question him rather than speak fact what going talk about think fact subject that probably better served conversation than address and guess have bit new clip precede rather since the september attack the world trade center many people have down new york see and pay respect what amount the acre burial ground now cbs s jim axelrod reports they putting the finish touch new way for people visit and view the scene jim axelrod for the empire state building the statue liberty there s new place new york where the crowd are thickest ground zero tourist taken step daughter here from indian this was out all the tourist site new york city this was her number one pick thousands now line low broadway tourist been want come down here since this happened even the cold inter days honor and remember tourist s real s happened here this our many fact that seeing has become bit problem tourist think that people are very frustrated that they not able get closer see what s going but that about change record time team architect and construction work designed and built view platform ease the frustration and bring people closer man they get incredible panorama and understand think more completely the she total the destruction the place you think about ground zero unlike most any other tourist site america unlike the grand canyon the washington monument people come here see what s longer there david rockwell the first experience people will have here when they see this not construction site but this incredibly moving burial ground the walls are design people can fill them with their own memorial the way they already have along the current perimeter tourist from our heart affect just much the ramps are made simple material the kind plywood you see construction site which really the whole point the face america s worst destruction people are building again jim axelrod cbs new new york this not obvious subject the sensual segment but certainly david you are know know phrase you hate entertainment architect your work high sensual even hedonistic like that word s about pleasure casino and hotel and restaurant how did the shock that all and especially all new york felt the september trans into your desire this thing well the truth the matter post september felt myself the role original first all some who lives tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastat and some who work less than mile from there that was the role for people who work with firm continue have the same level enthusiasm about creating the place had been creating fact finish book which called pleasure which about sensual pleasure space but got tell you became possible that were really paralyzed and found myself the fri after september two days after wards literally able moti anyone anything gave the office few days off and discuss this with other architect had seen people saying the press that they should build the towers they were they should build them stories taller and thought was astonishing spec late this were competition something that was such fresh wound and had series discussion first with rick scofidio and liz diller who collaborated with this and several other people and really felt like had find relevance doing something and that people who create place the ultimate way help wasn pontificate make scenarios but help right now tried come with way group have kind design swat team and that was the miss that came with were you conscious suddenly designer whose work all about fulfilling want suddenly fulfilling needs well what was aware was there was this over whelm need act now and were asked participate few project before this there was school that had been evacuated down ground zero they move abandon school took about architect and designer and artist and over four days was like this urban bar raising renovate and everyone wanted help was just extraordinary otter contribut maira contribut and became this cathartic experience for and that was done effect october something yeah obviously what you face trying something substantial this project and this only one four that you designed surround the site you must have run against the incredibly zantine entrenched bureaucracy and power that new york real estate and new york politic well s funny thing finish and had dinner with small group was actually asked committee chair committee build and several meeting and there were the most circuit grand plan that had with long term infrastructure and building the entire city and the fact that there were immediate wound and needs that needed fill and there was talk about clusi and want inclusive process and wasn inclusive group said what was not inclusive group was not inclusive group was dominant white rich corpo group that was not representati the city shock yeah surprising rick and liz and kevin and came with the idea the city actually approach first approach the city about pier saw how worked the families the victims the families were going this pier that was incredibly human izing the huds river yeah and the city actually through tim zagat ally and then through chris nicholas then got giuliani said you know don want anything with pier right now but have observ ation platform for the families down ground zero that like more dignified experience for the families and way protect from the weather went down there with rick and liz and kevin and got say was the most moving experience life was devastat see the simple plywood platform with rail around where the families the victims had left not them and there was mediation between and the experience there was filter and remember september street the roof our building can see the world trade towers pro and saw the first building collapse from conference room the eighth floor that had set and then everyone was the roof ran there and was amazing how much hard was believe real life than was there was something about the comfort the filter and how much information was between and the experience seeing this very simple dignified way was very powerful experience went back the city and said not particular interested the upgrade this platform but spent some time down there the same time the city had this need they were looking for solution deal with thousand people day who were going down there that had where and there was way deal with the traffic around the site deal with just immediate master plan there was way there had way get people move around the site but then you got figure out way will over the insane tedious process getting permits and getting everybody board but simply funding this thing looks like fairly simple thing but this was half million dollar project well knew that wasn private fun wasn going happen and also frank knew that didn happen the end the giuliani administration then everyone who were deal with the and the police department and all the were meeting with people with the city time and was set the office emergency man ment this incredible act their part because they really wanted this and they sense that this needed happen and there was therefore this tick lock because giuliani was obviously out three months after that yeah the first thing had was find way get this had work with the families the victims through the city make sure that they knew this was happening because this didn want surprise and also had under the radar screen could new york because the key was not raising lot object and sort working quiet possible came with the idea set foundation mainly because when found contractor who would build this would not agree this even would pay him the money there needed foundation place came with foundation and actually what happened was one major develop new york who hall remain name guess yeah his ials are and own rockefeller center that help anyone volunteered help and met with him the price from the contractor were between five dollars and atlantic hey who s the large scaffolding contractor the country volunteered cost this develop said you know what under write the entire ense and said that s incredible and think this was the and knew this had built and the and had start construction the next day had meeting that even with his contractor choice and the contractor showed with the draw the platform about half the size that had draw sort like the spinal tap scene where you get the tiny little nehenge guess fact was this was going window was scaffolding there was sense the fact that this next saint paul that this really place that needs kind dignified and place reflect and remember and got say that spent lot time putting this together watch the crowd that gather saint paul which just the right and moving around the site and live down there spent lot time looking the need and think people were amaz two things think they were amaz the destruction but think there was sense belief about the heroics new york that found very moving just the sort every heroics new york were this meeting and the contractor literally said going lock the door because this develop will not agree have you leave till you sign off this and said well this half the size doesn have any the design features that have been agree everyone everyone the city have back the beginning this and convince him that should leave the room with the agree build designed the next day got email from the develop saying that was with draw all funding didn know what but decided cast very wide net email out letter many people could several people the audience here who were very help there was thought abandon ship that point fact told the contractor ahead had already order material based ahead knew that one way another this was going happen and just felt had happen you were funding your and with contribut and this foundation richard think very correct made the point the beginning before all the chair designer came out about the history chair designer impos aesthetic solution this kind universal banal common problem sitting seems with this that was the opposite that this was unprecedented singular design problem well here s the issue knew that this was not the sense think about the site and think about the need for memorial was important that this not categorized memorial that this was place for people reflect remember kind quiet place led using design solution that create few filter between the view said about the families platform and the experience possible s all incredibly humble material s scaffolding and plywood and sort the process the move saint paul s and down the other side give you about feet feet from the ground where you get the degree view but the design was drive need quick cheap safe respect flexible one the other things this designed move because when looked the four platform around the site one which upgrade the families platform knew that these had move respond changing conditions and the changing definition what ground zero your work mean talked about this before lot your work think your belief your focus the temporari all things and the evanesc things and kind eat drink and merry for tomorrow die sort sense exist this clear not work for the age you know couple years this thing isn going here did that require architect new way thinking about what you were doing think this pure temporary in ation don think think this obviously substantial different from anything ever thought about doing before just the nature where over with thought about our work general number one the notion collaborati sort way get things done and kevin kenn rick scofidio liz diller and all the people with the city norman lear who spoke four hours before our dead for funding offer give bridge loan help get through the notion collaborati think this reinforces how important that and terms the temporary nature our goal was not create something that would there longer than needed think what were most interested was promoting kind dialogue that felt may not have been happening enough this city about what s really happening there and day two before opened was giuliani s well address where propose the idea all ground zero being memorial which was very controversial but resonate with lot people and think regard what the positi about how this sacred piece land used having come out actually seeing real counter think makes more powerful dialogue and that s what were interested that very much the real things been interested before seems among other things love piece civic infrastructure enable that conversation get serious and six months after the fact and only few months away from the site being clean are very quickly now getting the point where those conversation about what should there are getting serious you have having been physical involved the site you have been doing this project have any ideas about what should shouldn done well think one thing that shouldn done evaluate think right now the discussion very close discussion the master plan the tetch gallery recent had show ideas for building which had some sort ideas building but had some really terrible ideas and also felt little bit like kind competition ideas where think the focus ideas should master planning and uses and think there should broader which there s starting the dialogue really open what does this site really want and truly believe until the issue memorial sort out that s going very hard have intelligent discussion there s few discussion right now that think are very positi about depressi the west side highway and connect this over that there s one uninterrupted piece land well think that s interesting and gets another issue that was probably appropriate discuss six months ago but perhaps isn now which not many love the world trade center piece architecture what had done this city and that huge plaza this opportunity the silver lining silver lining here build some more traditional city not think there s real opportunity eng discussion why live cities and why live place where such similar people collide against each day don think has much with thousand new office space regard what the number yeah think there chance look how think about cities and fact there s posal the table now for building number even which was the building just nor the towers right which the towers fell into and the reason that s been held essential community rage that they not open the street connect that back the rest the city think public dialogue think you know like see inter national competition and call for ideas for uses whether s art whether s housing whether s what amount shop right and looking for other things this small foundation put together looking for other way help including taking small piece adjacent the site and architect who current don have voice new york artist housing and find other way encourage the discussion against sort monolithic single solution and more about multi city things before end know you have piece digital video the experience being this platform john kamen who s here actually put together two and half minute piece that show the platform use thought that would good end with looking from ful street west one the trick issues had with the giuliani administration was had gotten how anti graffiti was and essential our structure was designed written you say s not memorial but were you conscious memorial the vietnam memorial those kinds form certainly did much research could and were conscious other memorial and also the complex and length time they really take s people the committee for oklahoma city which why thought this sort hoc sponta neous solution that expanded union square and the place that were hoc memorial the city already the scaffolding you can see built over the street moun table what s interesting now the nature the site has totally changed that what you aware not just the destruction the building ground zero but all the building around and the cars the building around which are enormous this show saint paul s the left just want thank you half new york for making this happen and getting this done but the kind virtual stanta neous nature it erecti and it being there almost before you could believe that response this magnitude could accomplished part it extraordinary don know beauty the word but pre was honor and were thrill able show here
