seckel cognitive neuro scientist explore the perceptual illusions that fool our brains loads eye trick help him prove that not only are easily fool kind like arts brain cognitive science culture design illusion psychology seckel says our brains are wired going talk new lecture just for ted and going show you some illusions that created for ted and going try relate this happiness what was thinking about with happiness what gives happiness happiness which with joy particular area and think there s something very fundamental and was thinking about this and s terms both illusions and movie that see and joke and magic shows that there s something about these things where our expectations are violate some sort pleasing way you see movie and has unexpected twist something that you didn expect and you find joyful experience you look those sort illusions book and s not what you expect and there s something joyful about and s the same thing with joke and all these sorts things what going try and lecture little bit further and see can violate your expectations pleasing way mean sometimes expectations that are violate are not pleasant but going try pleasant way very primal way can make the audience here happy going show you some ways that can violate your expectations first all want show you the particular illusion here want you first all when pop the screen notice that the two hole are perpendic ular each other these are all perceptual trick these are real objects that going show you now going show you how done loop the film here you can get very interesting experience want you see how this illusion construct and s going rotate you see that s inside out now watch rotate back how quickly your perception snap now watch rotate back again and this very bright audience all right see you can stop from happening even though you know percent s true that bam you can what does that tell you about ourselves going again doubt about see you can stop from happening s difficult and can violate your expectations whole variety ways about representation about shape about color and forth and s very primal and s interesting question pond why these things find these things joyful why would find them joyful here s something that lionel did while ago like these sort little things like this again this not optic trick this what you would see other words s not camera cut s perceptual trick can violate your expectations about shape can violate your expectations representation what image represent what you see here how many you here see dolphins raise your hand you see dolphins those people who raised their hands afterwards the rest the audience talk them all right actually this the best example prim experience that know you are child under the age who haven been ruin yet you will look this image and see dolphins now some you adults here are saying what dolphins what dolphins but fact you reverse the figure ground other words the dark areas here ask for point but you reverse you see whole series little dolphins the way you also student caltech they also tend just see the dolphins s based now something like this can used because this after all talk about design too this was done saatchi and saatchi and they actually got away with this australia you look this for all those people are sort provoc ative position but they got passed and actually won the clio award s funny how you can remember that sort this the joke did when the florida ball was going around you know count the for gore count the for bush count again you can violate your expectations about experience here outside water founta that created with some friends mine but you can stop the water drop and actually make all the drop levitate this something building for you know ment parks and that kind stuff now let s take static image can you see this you see the middle section moving down and the section moving s completely static s static image how many people see this illusion s completely static right now when s interesting that when look image see you know color depth texture and you can look this whole scene and analyze you can see the woman closer than the wall and forth but the whole thing actually flat s paint s trompe oeil and was such good trompe oeil that people got irritated when they tried talk the woman and she wouldn respond now you can make design mistakes like this building new york that when you see from this side looks like the balconies tilt and when you walk around the other side looks like the balconies down there are case where you have mistakes design that you take this particular touched photograph now interesting enough get lot emails from people who say there any perceptual difference between male and female and really say mean women can navigate through the world just well male can and why wouldn they however this the one illusion that women can consistent better than male match which head because they re fashion cue they can match the hat okay now getting part want show design illusions believe that the first example illusions being used purpose was vinci this morph image eye that when you saw from one little angle was like this and this little technique got popular the century and the century guise hidden meaning where you could flip the image and see from one little point view like this but these are early corporation illusions brought sort high point with hans holbein s ambassadors and hans holbein worked for henry this was hung wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull all right now going show you some designers who work with illusions give that element surprise one favorite scott worked with scott create some illusions for ted that hope you will enjoy have one here ted and happiness now arthur hasn talked yet but his going light talk and has some his really fantastic machines outside and scott created this wonderful tribute arthur well there s analog and digital thought that was appropriate here and figure goes ground and for the musician and course since happiness want joy the now another great designer s very well known japan fukuda and just build some fantastic things this simply amazing this pile junk that when you view from one particular angle you see reflect the mirror perfect piano pianist transform violinist this really wild this assembl knives and spoon and various cutlery lded together gives shadow motorcycle you learn something the sort thing that which there are people out there with lot time ken know does wonderful composite images like creating jacques cousteau out seashell touched seashell but just rear rang them did einstein out dice because after all einstein said god does not play dice with the universe bert out touched keyboard will short cross word puzzle john cederquist does these wonderful trompe oeil now going skip ahead since sort running behind want show you quickly what created some new type illusions done something with taking the pixar type illusions you see these kids the same size here running down the hall the two table top the same size they looking out two direction once you have larger piece fitting with smaller and that s something for you think about all right you see larger pieces fitting within smaller pieces here does everyone see that which impossible you can see the two kids are looking out simultaneously out two different direction once now can you believe these two table top are the same size and shape they are you measured them they would and say those two figure are identical size and shape and s interesting doing this this sort render fashion how much strong the illusions are any case hope this has brought you little joy and happiness and you interested seeing more cool effects see outside happy show you lots things
