oxford philosopher and transhuman nick bostrom examines the future human kind and asks whether might alter the fundamental nature humanity solve our most intrinsic problems antidepressants biotech culture death future global issues happiness philosophy technology transhuman nick bostrom our biggest problems want talk today about been asked take the long view and going tell you what think are the three biggest problems for humanity from this long point view some these have already been touched upon other speaker which encouraging seems that there s not just one person who think that these problems are important the first death big problem you look the statistics the odds are not very favor able far most people who have lived have also died roughly percent everybody who has been alive has died now the annual death rate add sorry the daily death rate people per day which huge number any standard the annual death rate then becomes million just look the single biggest cause death aging account for roughly two third all human people who die that add annual death greater than the population canada sometimes don see problem because either s too familiar s too big can see because s too big think death might both too familiar and too big for most people see problem once you think about you see this not statistical point these are let s see how far have talked talked for three minutes that would roughly people have died since begun speaking people like s roughly the population this room has just died now the human cost that obvious once you start think about the suffering the loss s also economically enormous waste just look the information and knowledge and experience that lost due natural causes death general and aging particular suppose approxim ated one person with one book now course this under estimation person s life time learning and experience lot more than you could put into single book but let s suppose did this million people die natural causes each year corresponds then million volume destroyed library congress hold million volume are upset about the burning the library alex s one the great cultural tragedies that remember even today but this the equivalent three libraries congress burn down ever lost each year that s the first big problem and wish speed aubrey grey and other people like him try something about this soon possible existential risk the second big problem existential risk threat human survival the long term potential our species now why say that this big problem well let s first look the probability and this very very difficult estimate but there have been only four studies this recent years which surprising you would think that would some interest try find out more about this given that the takes are big but s very neglect area but there have been four studies one john wrote book this estimate probability that will fail survive the current century percent similar the astronomer royal whom heard speak yesterday also has percent probability estimate another author doesn give any numeric estimate but says the probability significant that will fail wrote long paper this said assign less than percent probability would mistake light the current evidence have now the exact figure here should take with big grain salt but there seems consensus that the risk substantial everybody who has looked this and studied agree now think about what just reducing the probability human extinction just one percentage point not very much that s equivalent million lives saved just count the currently living people the current generation now one percent six billion people equivalent million that s large number were take into account future generation that will never come into existence blow ourselves then the figure becomes astronomical could eventually colon chunk the universe the virgo super cluster maybe will take million years get there but extinct never will then even one percentage point reduction the extinction risk could equivalent this astronomical number the power you take into account future generation much our own every other moral ative philanthropic cost just becomes relevant the only thing you should focus would reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope achieve and even you just look the current people and ignore the potential that would lost went extinct should still have high priority now let spend the rest time the third big problem because s more subtle and perhaps difficult grasp think about some time your life some people might never have experience but some people there are just those moment that you have experience where life was fantastic might have been the moment some great creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage when you understood something you had never done before perhaps the ecstasy romantic love aesthetic experience great piece art every once while have these moment and realize just how good life can when s best and you wonder why can like that all the time you just want cling this and then course drift back into ordinary life and the memory fade and s really difficult call normal frame mind just how good life can best how bad can worst the third big problem that life isn usually wonderful could think that s big big problem s easy say what don want here are number things that don want illness voluntary death necessary suffering cruel stunted growth memory loss ignorance absence creativity suppose fix these things did something about all these were very successful got rid all these things might end with something like this which mean s heck lot better than that but this really the best can dream this the best can possible find something little bit more inspiring work towards and think about this think s very clear that there are ways which could change things not just eliminating negative but adding positive wish list least would much longer healthier lives greater subject well being enhance cognitive capacities more knowledge and understanding limited opportunity for personal growth beyond our current biological limits better relationship bounded potential for spiritual moral and intellectual development want achieve this what the world would have change and this the answer would have change not just the world around but ourselves not just the way think about the world but the way are our very biology human nature would have change now when think about changing human nature the first thing that comes mind are these human modification technologies growth hormone therapy cosmetic surgery stimul ants like rital anti depressant bolic ster oids artificial heart s pretty path list they great things for few people who suffer from some specific condition but for most people they don really transform what human and they also all seem little bit most people have this instinct that well sure there needs anti depressant for the really depressed people but there s kind queasi ness that these are natural some way s worth calling that there are lot other modification technologies and enhancement technologies that use have skin enhancement clothing far can see all you are users this enhancement technology this room that s great thing mood modifiers have been used from time memorial caffeine alcohol nicotine immune system enhancement vision enhancement anesthetics take that very much for grant but just think about how great progress that like having operation before anesthetics was not fun contraceptives cosmetic and brain reprogramming technique that sounds ominous but the distinct between what technology gadget would the arche type and other ways changing and writing human nature quite subtle you think about what means learn arithmetic learn read you actually literally writing your own brain you changing the micro structure your brain you along broad sense don need think about technology only little gadget like these things here but even institution and technique psychological methods and forth forms organization can have profound impact human nature looking ahead there range technologies that are almost certain developed sooner later are very ignorant about what the time scale for these things are but they all are consistent with everything know about physical laws laws chemistry etc s possible assume setting side possibility catastrophe that sooner later will develop all these and even just couple these would enough transform the human condition let s look some the dimension human nature that seem leave room for improvement health span big and urgent thing because you not alive then all the other things will little avail intellectual capacity let s take that box which fall into lot different sub categories memory concentration mental energy intelligence empathy these are really great things part the reason why value these traits that they make better with other people they position good but part the reason and that s the reason why have ethical ground for pursuing these that they also intrinsic ally valuable s just better able understand more the world around you and the people that you are communicating with and remember what you have learned modal ities and special faculties now the human mind not single unit information process but has lot different special evolved modul that specific things for you think about what normally take giving life lot meaning music humor erotic spiritual aesthetic nurtu ring and car gossip chat with people all these very likely are enable special circuitry that humans have but that you could have another intelligent life form that lack these just lucky that have the requi site neural machinery process music and appreciate and enjoy all these would enable principle enable enhancement some people have better musical ability and ability appreciate music than others have s also interesting think about what other things are these all enable great value why should think that evolution has happened provide with all the modal ities would need engage with other value that there might imagine species that just didn have this neural machinery for process music and they would just star with baffle ment when spend time listening beautiful performance like the one just heard because people making stupid movement and they would really irritated and wouldn see what were but maybe they have another faculty something else that would seem equally rational but they actually tap into some great possible value there but are just literally deaf that kind value could think adding different new sensory capacities and mental faculties bodily functional and morph ology and affect self control greater subject well being able switch between relaxation and activity being able slow when you need that and speed able switch back and forth more easily would neat thing able easier achieve the flow state when you totally immersed something you are doing scient ness and sympathy the ability s another interesting application that would have large social ramification perhaps you could actually choose preserve your romantic attachment one person diminish through time that wouldn have love would never have fade you didn want that s probably not all that difficult might just simple hormone something that could this s been done vole you can engineer prairie vole become monogamous when s natural polygamous s just single gene might more complicated humans but perhaps not that much this the last picture that want now got use the laser point possible mode being here would way life way being experiencing thinking seeing interacting with the world down here this little corner here have the little sub space this larger space that accessible human beings beings with our biological capacities s part the space that s accessible animals since are animals are subset that and then you can imagine some enhancement human capacities there would different modes being you could experience you were able stay alive for say years then you could live sorts lives and accumulate wisdom that are just not possible for humans currently are then you move off this larger sphere human and you could continue that process and eventually explore lot this larger space possible modes being now why that good thing well know already that this little human circle there there are these enormous wonderful and worth while modes being human life best wonderful have reason believe that within this much much larger space there would not also extremely worth while modes being perhaps ones that would way beyond our wild ability even imagine dream about and fix this third problem think need slowly carefully with ethical wisdom and constraint develop the means that enable out this larger space and explore and find the great value that might hide there thanks
