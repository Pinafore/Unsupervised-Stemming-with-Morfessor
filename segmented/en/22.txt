why people see the virgin mary cheese sandwich hear demonic heaven using video and music skeptic michael shermer show how convince ourselves believe and over the fact culture entertainment faith illusion religion science michael shermer strange belief hey michael shermer the direct the skeptic society the publish skeptic magazine investigate claim the par normal pseudo science and fringe group and cult and claim all kinds between science and pseudo science and non science and junk science voodoo science patho logical science bad science non science and plain old sense and less you been mars recent you know there s lot that out there some people call debunkers which kind negat term but let s face there s lot bunk and are like the bunk squads the police department out there flush out well sort like the ralph naders bad ideas trying place bad ideas with good ideas show you example bad idea brought this with this was give nbc date test s the s produce the quadro corpo ation west virgin s called the quadro dowse this was being high school administrators for dollars piece s piece plastic with radio hack antenna attached you could dowse for all sort things but this particular one was built dowse for marijuana student lock the way work you down the hall and you see tilts toward particular lock and then you open the lock looks something like this show you well has kind right lean bias show well this science control experiment this way for sure sir you want empty your pockets please sir the question was can actually find marijuana student lock and the answer you open enough them yes but science have keep track the miss not just the hits and that s probably the key less short talk here that this how psychics work astrologers and tarot card reader and people remember the hits they for the miss science have keep the whole database and look see the number hits somehow stand out from the total number that you would expect chance this case test had two opaque box one with govern approved marijuana and one with nothing and got percent the time which exactly what you expect with flip model that s just fun little example here the sort things skeptic the quarter public ation each one has particular the like this one the future intelligence are people getting smart dumb have opini this myself because the business but fact people turns out are getting smart three point per years going sort interesting thing with science don think skeptic thing even science thing are science and religion compatible s like are science and plumbing compatible these they just two different things science not thing s ver s way thinking about things s way looking for natural explanation for all phenomena mean what s more likely that extraterrestrial intelligence multi dimens being travel across the vast tances inter stellar space leave crop circle farm s field puckerb kansas promote skeptic com our page more likely that reader skeptic did this with photo and all case have ask what s the more likely explanation and before say something out this world should first make sure that s not this world what s more likely that arn had little extraterrestrial help his run for the govern ship that the world week new makes stuff and part that the same the express nice here this sidney harr cartoon for those you the back says here then miracle occur think you need more exp here step two this single slide completely dis the intelligent design argument there s nothing more than that you can say miracle occur s just that doesn explain anything doesn offer anything there s nothing test s the end the conversation for intelligent design creationists where and s true scientist sometimes throw terms out linguistic place fill dark energy dark matter something like that until figure out what just call this s the beginning the causal chain for science for intelligent design creationists s the end the chain again can ask this what s more likely are ufo alien space ship perceptual cognitive mistakes even fake this ufo from house altadena california looking down over pasadena and looks lot like buick hubcap s because you don even need photo you don need high tech equipment you don need computer this was with throw kodak stamatic camera you just have somebody off the side with hubcap read camera s read that s although s possible that most these things are fake illusion and that some them are real s more likely that all them are fake like the crop circle more serious not all science looking for balance between data and theory the case galileo had two problems when turned his telescope saturn first all there was theory planet rings and second all his data was grainy and fuzzy and couldn quite make out what was was looking wrote that had seen have observ that the furthest planet has three bodies and this what ended conclu that saw without theory planet rings and with only grainy data you can have good theory and wasn solved until this chris tiaan huygens s book which cataloged all the mistakes that people made trying figure out what was going with saturn wasn till huygens had two things had good theory planet rings and how the solar system opera and then had better telescopic more fine grain data which could figure out that the earth going around faster according kepler s law than saturn then catch with and see the angles the rings different angles there and that fact turns out true the problems with having theory that your theory may load with cognitive bias one the problems explain why people believe things that have things simple level and then more serious one like have tend see faces this the face mars which was where there was whole move get nasa photograph that are because people thought this was monument architecture made ians well turns out here s the close from you squint you can still see the face and when you squint what you doing you turn that from fine grain coarse grain and you reducing the quality your data and didn tell you what look for you still see the face because program evolution see faces faces are important for social and course happy faces faces all kinds are easy see you can see the happy face mars there astrono were frog perhaps they see kerm the frog you see him there little frog legs geologists were elephants religious icon ography covered tennes baker charg five bucks head come see the till got ease and desist from mother teresa s law here s our lady guadalupe and our lady wats ville just down the street the street from here tree bark particular good because s nice and grainy branchy black and white splotchy and you can get the pattern seeking humans are pattern seeking animals here s the virgin mary the side glass window sao paul now here s the virgin mary made her appearance cheese sandwich which got actually hold las casino course this being america this casino paid dollars for the cheese sandwich but who does really look like the virgin mary has that sort puckered lips s look virgin mary clear water florida actually went see this one there was lot people there the faith come their wheelchairs and crutches and and went down investigate just give you size that s dawkins and the amazing randi next this two two and half story size image all these candles many thousands candles people had tribute this walk around the back just see what was going here where turns out where there s sprinkler head and palm tree you get the effect here s the virgin mary the back which they started wipe off guess you can only have one miracle per building really miracle mary miracle marge and then going finish with another example this with audio auditory illusion there this film white noise with michael about the dead talking back the way this whole business talking the dead s not that big deal body can turns out s getting the dead talk back that s the really hard part this case supposed these message are hidden electronic phenomena there s reverse speech

hear again you can miss when tell you what s there all right going just end with positi nice little story about the skeptic non education organ ization always looking for little good things that people and england there s pop singer very one the top popular singer england today katie melua and she wrote beautiful song was the top five called nine million bicycles beijing s love story she s sort the nor the about how she much love her guy and compare nine million bicycles and for and she has this one pass here are billion light years from the edge that s guess one can ever say s true but know that will always with you well that s nice least she got close america would light years from the edge but friend simon singh the article physicist now turned science educat and wrote the book the big bang and uses every chance gets promote good science and wrote piece the guardian about katie s song which said well know exactly how old how far from the edge you know s s billion light years and s not guess know with precise error bars there how close and can say although not absolutely true that s pretty close being true and his katie called him after this piece came out and said embarrass was member the astrono club and should have know better and she cut the song end with the new version are billion light years from the edge the observ univers that s good estim with well define error bars and with the available information predict that will always with you how cool that
