jacqueline novogratz applauds the world s height ened interest africa and poverty but argue persuasi for new approach africa bottom business culture development entrepreneur global issues investment micro finance philanthropy poverty social change women jacqueline novogratz invest africa s own solutions want start with story seth from when was years old uncle ed gave beautiful blue sweater least thought was beautiful and had fuzzy zebra walking across the stomach and mount kilimanjaro and mount were kind right across the chest that were also fuzzy and wore when ever could thinking was the most fabulous thing owned until one day ninth grade when was standing with number the foot ball players and body had clearly changed and mussolina who was undeni ably high school said boom voice that longer had far away ski trips but could all ski mount novogratz and was humili ated and mort ified that immediately ran home mother and chastised her for ever letting wear the hideous sweater drove the good will and threw the sweater away some what ious idea being that would never have think about the sweater nor see ever again fast forward years later year old kid working kigali rwanda ging through the steep slope when see feet front little boy years old running toward wear sweater and thinking this not possible but curious run the child course the living jesus out him grab him the collar turn over and there name written the collar this sweater tell that story because has served and continue serve metaphor about the level connected ness that all have this earth often don realize what our action and our action does people think will never see and never know also tell because tells larger contextual story what aid and can that this travel into the good will virginia and moved way into the larger industry which that point was giving millions tons second hand clothing africa and asia which was very good thing providing low cost clothing and the same time certainly rwanda destroyed the local tail industry not say that shouldn have but that have get better answer the questions that need considered when think about consequence and response going stick rwanda circa where was doing two things had started bakery with unwed mother were called the bad news bear and our notion was were going corner the snack food business kigali which was not hard because there were snack before and because had good business model actually did and watched these women transform micro level but the same time started micro finance bank and tomorrow iqbal quadir going talk about gram which the grandfather all micro finance bank which now worldwide movement you talk about but then was quite new especially economy that was moving from barter into trade got lot things right focused business model insisted skin the game the women made their own decisions the end the day how they would use this access credit build their little business earn more income they could take care their families better what didn understand what was happening all around with the confluence fear ethnic strife and certainly aid game you will that was playing into this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside rwanda that that time percent the budget was all foreign aid the genocide happened seven years after these women all worked together build this dream and the good news was that the institution the bank institution last fact became the largest rehabilitation lend the country the bakery was completely wipe out but the lesson for were that account ability count got build things with people the ground using business models where steven levitt would say the incentive matter understand however complex may incentive matter when chris raised how wonderful everything that was happening the world that were seeing shift zeitgeist the one hand absolutely agree with him and was thrilled see what happened with the that the world because people like tony blair and bono and bob geldof the world talking about global poverty the world talking about africa ways have never seen life s thrill and the same time what keep night fear that look the vict ories the billion dollars increased aid africa billion reduce debt the vict more than chapter one our moral solution and fact what need see that chapter one celebrate close and recognize that need chapter two that all about execution all about the how and you remember one thing from what want talk about today s that the only way end poverty make history build viable systems the ground that deliver critical and afford able good and service the poor ways that are financial sustainable and scale able that really can make poverty history and was that that whole philosophy that encourage start current endeavor called acumen fund which trying build some mini blue prints for how might that water health and housing pakistan india kenya tanzania and egypt and want talk little bit about that and some the examples you can see what that doing but before this and this another one pet peeves want talk little bit about who the poor are because too often talk about them these strong huge mass people year ning free when fact s quite amazing story macro level four billion people earth make less than four dollars day that s who talk about when think about the poor you aggregate s the third largest economy earth and yet most these people invisible where typically work there s people making between one and three dollars day who are these people they are farmers and factory workers they work government office they driver they are domestic they typically pay for critical good and service like water like healthcare like housing and they pay times what their middle class counter parts pay certainly where work karachi and nairobi the poor also are willing make and make smart decisions you give them that opportunity two examples one india where there are million farmers most whom make less than two dollars day where work aura the land extraordinarily ched you see people average making cents dollar this guy pink social entrepreneur named ami tabar what did was see what was happening israel larger approach and figure out how irrig ation which way bringing water directly the plant stock but previous s only been created for large scale farm ami tabar took this and modul ized down eighth acre couple principles build small make infinite expand able and afford able the poor this family sarita and her husband bought dollar unit when they were living literally three wall lean with corrugated iron roof after one harvest they had increased their income enough buy second system their full quarter acre couple years later meet them they now make four dollars day which pretty much middle class for india and they showed the concrete foundation they had just laid build their house and wear you could see the future that woman s eyes something truly believe you can talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets and again give jeff sachs harvard huge kudos for bringing the world this notion his rage for five dollars you can save life malaria disease that kill one three million people year million case are reported s estimate that africa lose about billion dollars year the disease five dollars can save life can send people the moon can see there s life mars why can get five dollar nets million people the question though not why can the question how can help african this for themselves lot hurdles one production too low two price too high three this good road right near where our factory located distribution nightmare but not impossible started making dollar loan the largest traditional bed net manufacture africa that they could transfer technology from japan and build these long last five year nets here are just some pictures the factory today three years later the company has employed another thousand women contribute about dollars wages the economy tanzania s the largest company tanzania the through rate right now million nets three million the end the year hope have seven million the end next year the production side working the distribution side though world have lot work right now percent these nets are being bought the and then given primarily people around africa looking building some the most precious resource africa people their women and want you meet jacqueline name sake years old she were born anywhere else but tanzania telling you she could run wall street she runs two the lines and has already saved enough money put down ment her house she makes about two dollars day creating education fund and told she not marry nor having children until these things are complete and when told her about our idea that maybe could take tupperw model from the united states and find way for the women themselves out and sell these nets others she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed took lesson from ideo one our favorite companies and quickly did prototyping this and took jacqueline into the area where she lives she brought the women with whom she interact together see she could sell these nets five dollars piece despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one and learned lot about how you sell things not coming with our own notion because she didn even talk about malaria until the very end first she talked about comfort status beauty these nets she said you put them the floor bug leave your house children can sleep through the night the house looks beautiful you hang them the window and started making curtain and not only beautiful but people can see status that you care about your children only then did she talk about saving your children s lives lot lesson learned terms how sell good and service the poor want end just saying that there s enormous opportunity make poverty history right have build business models that matter that are scale able and that work with african indian people all over the developing world who fit this category themselves because the end the day s about engage ment s about understanding that people really don want hand that they want make their own decisions they want solve their own problems and that engaging with them not only create much more dignity for them but for well and urge all you think next time how engage with this notion and this opportunity that all have make poverty history really becoming part the process and moving away from and them world and realizing that s about all and the kind world that together want live and share thank you
