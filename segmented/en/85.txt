accepting the ted prize bill clinton asks for help bringing health care rwanda and the rest the world africa ted prize business culture economics global issues haiti health care technology bill clinton rebuild rwanda thought getting ted wish would try begin putting perspective what try and how fits with what they try live world that everyone know inter dependent but sufficient three major ways first all profound unequal half the world s people still living less than two dollars day billion people with access clean water two and half billion access sanitation billion going bed hungry every night one four deaths every year from aids malaria and the variety infection associated with dirty water percent them under five years age even wealthy countries common now see equality growing the united states since had five years economic growth five years productivity growth the work place but median wages are stagn and the percentage working families drop ping below the poverty line four percent the percentage working families without health care four percent this inter dependent world which has been pretty good most which why all here northern california doing what for living enjoy this evening profound unequal also unstable unstable because the threat terror weapon mass destruction the spread global disease and sense that are vulnerable way that weren not many years ago and perhaps most important all sustainable because climate change resource depleti and species destruction when think about the world would like leave daughter and the grandchildren hope have world that move away from unequal unstable sustainable inter dependence integrated communities local national and global that share the characteristic all successful communities broad shared accessible set opportunities shared sense responsibility for the success the common enterprise and genuine sense long all easier said than done when the terrorist incident occurred the united kingdom couple years ago think even though they didn claim many lives lost the united states think the thing that trouble the british most was that the ators were not invade but home grown citizens whose religious and political entities were more important them than the people they grew with went school with worked with shared weekends with shared meal with other words they thought their difference were more important than their common humanity the central psychological plague human kind the century into this mix people like who are not public office have more power good than any time history because more than half the world s people live under government they vote and can vote out and even non democratic government are more sensitive public opinion because primarily the power the internet people modes means can band together and mass vast sum money that can change the world for some public good they all agree when the tsunami hit south asia the united states contribute billion dollars percent our household gave half them gave over the internet the median contribution was somewhere around dollars and third because the rise non government organization they business other citizens groups have enormous power affect the lives our fellow human beings when became president there were none these organization russia there are now couple hundred thousand none india there are now least half million active none china there are now register with the government probably twice again that many who are not register for political reasons when organized foundation and thought about the world and the world that hope leave the next generation and tried real istic about what had cared about all life that could still have impact wanted focus activities that would help eviate poverty fight disease combat climate change bridge the religious racial and other divide that ment the world but way that would either use whatever particular skills could put together our group change the way some public good function was perform that would weep across the world more you saw one reference that what were able with aids drugs and want say that the head our aids effort and the person who also primarily active the wish make night ira magazine here with and want thank him for everything s done s over there when got out office and was asked work first the caribbean try help deal with the aids crisis generic drugs were available for about dollars person year you bought them vast bulk you could get them little under dollars the first country went work the bahamas was paying dollars for these drugs the market was terribly organized that they were buying this medicine through two agent who were gigg them seven fold the very first week were working got the price down dollars and all sudden they could save seven times many lives for the same amount money then went work with the manufacturers aids medicine one whom was cited the film and negotiate whole different change business strategy because even dollars these drugs were being sold high margin low volume certain ment basis worked improving the productivity the operation and the supply chain and went low margin high volume absolutely certain ment business joke that the main contribution made the battle against aids was get the manufacturers change from jewelry store grocery store strategy but the price went dollars from and pretty soon the average price was dollars now can get for about dollars children s medicine was dollars because nobody could afford buy any negotiate down then the french imposed their brilliant conceived airline tax create something called unit got bunch other countries help that children s medicine now dollars person year the only thing that keeping from basically saving the lives everybody who needs the medicine stay alive are the absence systems necessary diagnose treat and care for people and deliver this medicine started childhood obesity initiative with the heart association america tried the same thing negoti ating industry right deal with the soft drink and the snack food industry cut the caloric and other dangerous content food going our children the school just organized the market and occurred that this whole non government world somebody needs thinking about organizing public good market and that now what trying and working with this large cities group fight climate change negotiate huge big volume deal that will enable cities which generate percent the world s greenhouse gases drastic ally and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions way that good economics and this whole discussion s some sort economic burden mystery think s bird s nest the ground when gore won his well deserve oscar for the convenient truth movie was thrilled but had urge him make second movie quickly for those you who saw convenient truth the most important slide the gore lecture the last one which shows here s where greenhouse gases are going don anything here s where they could and then there are six different categories things can change the trajectory need movie those six categories and all you need have embedded your brains and organize ourselves around trying that organizing these market one thing try now have taken second thing and this gets wish has been experience working developing countries that while the head lines may all the pessimistic head lines may say well can this that the other thing because corruption think capacity far bigger problem poor countries than corruption and feed corruption now have the money given these low price distribute aids drugs all over the world people cannot present reach today these low price are available the countries where work and total countries and about people are getting the benefits them but the money there reach others the systems are not there reach the people what have been trying working first rwanda and then malawi and other places but want talk about rwanda night develop model for rural health care very poor area that can used deal with aids malaria other infectious diseases maternal and child health and whole range health issues poor people are grappl with the developing world that can first scale for the whole nation rwanda and then will model that could literally implemented any other poor country the world and the test one will the job will provide high quality care and two will price that will enable the country sustain health care system without foreign after five years because the longer deal with these problems the more convinced that have whether s economics health education whatever have build systems and the absence systems that function break the connection which got you all this seat night you think about whatever your life has been however many obstacle you have faced your life critical juncture you always knew there was predict able connection between the effort you and the result you achieve world with systems with chaos everything becomes guerilla struggle and this predict ability not there and becomes almost impossible save lives educate kids develop economies whatever the person view who has done the best job this the health care area building system very poor area paul farmer who many you know has worked for now years with his group partners health primarily haiti where started but they also worked russia peru and other places around the world poor haiti the area where farmer s clinic active and they serve catch ment area far greater than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve since they have not lost one person tuberculosis not one and they achieve lot other amazing health results when decided work rwanda trying dramatically increase the income the country and fight the aids problem wanted build healthcare network because had been totally destroyed during the genocide and the per capita income was still under dollar day rang asked paul farmer would help because seemed could prove there was model haiti and model rwanda that could then take all over the country number one would wonderful thing for country that has suffer much any earth the last years and number two would have something that could then adapted any other poor country anywhere the world and have set about doing that now started working together months ago and working area called southern kayonza which one the poorest areas rwanda with group that originally include about people essentially implement what paul farmer did haiti develop and train paid community health workers who are able identify health problems ensure that people who have aids are properly diagnose and take their medicine regular who work bringing about health education clean water and sanitation providing nutrition supple ments and moving people the chain health care they have problems the that require the procedure that make this work have been perfect said paul farmer and his team their work rural haiti over the last years recently did evalu ation the first months our effort rwanda and the results were good that the rwanda government has now agreed adopt the model for the entire country and has strongly support and put the full resource the government behind tell you little bit about our team because s indic ative what have about people around the world working our aids program some them for nothing just for transportation room and board and then have others working these other related program our business plan rwanda was put together under the leadership noble who unusual gift woman but not unusual the type people who have been willing this kind work she was the young partner schroder venture london her s she was ceo successful venture she started and built re else venture and she decided she wanted something different with her life she now works full time this for very little pay she and her team former business people have created business plan that will enable scale this health system for the whole country and would worthy the kind private work she used when she was making lot more money for when came this rural area percent the children under the age five had stunted growth due malnutrition percent them died before they reached the age five mortality birth was over two and half percent over percent the deaths among adults and children occurred because parasite and diarrhea from dirty water and adequate sanitation all entirely preventable and treat able over percent the deaths were from respiratory illness again all preventable and treat able and not single soul this area was being treated for aids tuberculosis within the first months the following things happened went from zero about people being treated for aids that s percent the people who need treatment this area listen this less than four tenth one percent those being treated stopped taking their medicine otherwise fault treatment that s lower than the figure the united states less than three tenth one percent had transfer the more expensive second line drugs pregnant women were brought into counsel and will give birth for the first time within organized healthcare system that s about percent all the pregnancies about percent all the people said meant about percent all the people who need treatment are now getting just months from zero when started percent the children need infant feed program prevent malnutrition and early death are now getting the food supple ments they need stay alive and grow started the first malaria treatment program they ever had there patients admit hospital that was destroyed during the genocide that have renovate along with four other clinic complete with solar power generator good lab technology now are treating people month despite the fact that almost percent the aids patients are now treated home and the most important thing because implemented paul farmer s model using community health workers estimate that this system could put into place for all rwanda for between five and six percent gdp and that the government could sustain that without depending foreign aid after five six years and for those you who understand healthcare economics you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and percent gdp health care except for the united states spend but that s story for another day now working with partners health and the ministry health rwanda and our foundation folks scale this system also beginning this malawi and lesotho and have similar projects tanzania moza mbique kenya and ethiopia with other partners trying achieve the same thing save many lives quickly can but system atic way that can implemented nation wide and then with model that can implemented any country the world need initial front investment train doctors nurses health administration and community health workers throughout the country set the information technology the solar energy the water and sanitation the transportation infrastructure but over five year period will take down the need for outside assistance and eventually will phase out wish that ted assist our work and help build high quality rural health system poor country rwanda that can model for africa and indeed for any poor country anywhere the world belief that this will help build more integrated world with more partners and fewer terrorist with more productive citizens and fewer place all want our kids and our grandchildren grow has been honor for particularly work rwanda where also have major economic development project partnership with sir hunt the scott phil anthrop where last year using the same thing with aids drugs cut the cost fertilizer and the interest rates micro credit loan percent and achieve three four hundred percent increase crop yield with the farmers these people have been through lot and none most all helped them when they were the verge destroying each other doing that now and they are over and into their future doing this environmentally responsible way doing best convince them not run the electric grid the percent the people that have access but with clean energy have responsible station projects the rwanda interesting enough have been quite good wilson preserv their soil there s couple guys from southern farming families the first thing did when went out this place was get down hands and knee and dig the dirt and see what they done with have chance here prove that country that almost slaughte itself out existence can practice reconciliation organize itself focus tomorrow and provide comprehensive quality health care with minimal outside help grateful for this prize and will use that end could use some more help this but think what would mean could have world class health system rwanda country with less than one dollar day per capita income one that could save hundreds millions lives over the next decade applied every similar ated country earth s worth try and believe would succeed thank you and god bless you
