violate ted rules here and going read you something from book quickly can because think says something about revers our perception what think the good life the hut was made corrugated metal set concrete pad was cell armstrong brian shared with three other men armstrong and his friends had water they bought from near tap toilet the families this compound shared single pit latrine and sewers sanitation they did have electricity but was illegal service from someone else s wire and could only power one feeble bulb this was south land small shanty community the western side nairobi kenya but could been anywhere the city because more than half the city nairobi lives like this million people stuff into mud metal hut with service toilet rights armstrong explained the brutal reality their situation they paid ing rent about bucks month relatively high price for kenya shanty town and they could not afford late with the money case you owe one month the landlord will come with his henchmen and bundle you out will confiscate your things armstrong said not one month one day his room mate hilary kibagendi who was cooking ugali the spongy white corn meal concoct that the staple food the country cut into the conversation they called their landlord wabenzi meaning that person who has enough money drive merced benz hilary served the ugali with fry and tomato the sun slam down the thin steel roof and perspired ate after finished armstrong straight ened his tie put wool sports jack and head out into the outside mound garbage formed the border between south land and the adjacent legal neighborhood langata was perhaps eight feet feet long and feet wide and was set wider water ooze passed two boys were climb the mount kenya trash they couldn have been more than five six years old they were barefoot and with each step their sank into the muck sending hundreds flies scatte ring from the rancid pile thought they might playing king the hill but was wrong once the pile one the boys lower his short and defec ated the flies buzz hung rily around his legs when families people share single latrine boy ping garbage pile perhaps big thing but stood ring contrast something armstrong had said were eating that treasured the quality life his neighborhood for armstrong south land wasn con trained material conditions instead the human spirit radi ated out from the metal wall and garbage heap offer something legal neighborhood could freedom this place very addictive had said s simple life but nobody strict you nobody controlling what you once you have stayed here you cannot back meant back beyond that mountain trash back the legal city legal buildings with legal lease and legal rights once you have stayed here said you can stay for the rest your life has hope and this where these communities start this perhaps the most primitive shanty that you can find kibera little more than stick and mud hut next garbage heap this getting ready for the soon bombay india this home improvement putting plastic tarps your roof this rio janeiro and s getting bit better right seeing scavenged terra cott tile and little pieces sign and ster over the brick some color and this montakaya s house sultanbelyi and s getting even better s got fence scavenged door s got new tile the roof and then you get rocinha and you can see that s getting even better the buildings here are multi story they develop you can see the far right one where seems just stack top each other room after room after room and what people they develop their home one two stories and they sell their loggia roof rights and someone else build top their building and then that person sell the roof rights and someone else build top their building all these buildings are made out forced concrete and brick and then you get sultanbelyi turkey where s even built higher level design the crud the front mattress stuff and you see that all over turkey people dry out air out their mattress stuff their roof but the green building behind you can see that the top floor not occupied people are building with the possibility expansion and s built pretty high standard design and then you finally get squatter home like this which built the suburban model hey that s single family home the squatter community that s also istanbul turkey they quite vital places these communities this the main drag rocinha the estrada gave and there s bus route that runs through lots people out the street these communities these cities are actually more vital than the illegal communities they have more things going them this typical pathway rocinha called these are how you get around the community s very steep ground they built the hill land from the beach rio and you can see that the house are just tilevered over the natural obstruct ions that s just rock the hill side and these are normally very crowd and people hump furniture them refrigerators them all sorts things all carrie your shoulder very important thing brazil this commerce kenya right along the train track close the train track that the merchants sometimes have pull the merchandis out the way this market place also kenya market lots dealer almost everything you want buy those green things the fore ground are goes this shopping street kibera and you can see that there s dealer health clinic two beauty bar two grocery store and church and more s typical downtown street just happens self built this here the right hand side what s called you look the fine print under the ning s hotel and what hotel means kenya and india eating place that s restaurant people steal electrical power this rio people tap and they have thieves who are called grillos crick and they steal the electrical power and wire the neighborhood people burn trash get rid the garbage and they dig their own channel talk about more plastic bag than plankton and sometimes they have natural trash disposal and when they have more money they ment their streets and they put sewers and good water pipes and stuff like that this water going rio people run their water pipes all over the place and that little hut right there has pump and that s what people they steal electricity they install pump and they tap into the water main and pump water their house the question how you from the mud hut village the more developed city the even highly developed sultanbelyi say there are two things one people need guarantee they won evicted that does not necessarily mean property rights and would disagree with that question because property rights create lot complications they most often sold people and people then wind debt and have pay back the debt and sometimes have sell their property order pay back the debt there s whole variety other reasons why property rights sometimes don work these case but they need security and they need access politics and that can mean two things that can mean community organizing from below but can also mean possibilities from above and say that because the system turkey able turkey has two great laws that protect squatter one that s called gecekondu turkish which means built over night and you build your house over night turkey you can evicted without due process law they don catch you during the night and the second aspect that once you have people the community you can petition the government recognize legal sub municipal and when you legal sub municipal you suddenly have politics you allowed have elected government collect taxes provide municipal service and that s exactly what they these are the civic leaders the future the woman the center geeta jiwa she lives one those tent the highway median mumbai that s sure she also lives with her family the tent along the same highway median they very spoken they very active they can community leaders this woman nine which means grand turkish and there were three old ladies who lived that s her self built house behind her and they lived there for years and they are the back bone the community there this richard muthama peter and street photographer kibera makes money taking pictures the neighborhood and the people the neighborhood and great resource the community and finally choice run for mayor rio cezinio the fruit chant with his two kids here and more honest and giving and car man don know the future these communities the people and our ability work with those people think the message take from what read from the book from what armstrong said and from all these people that these are neighborhood the issue not urban poverty the issue not the larger over arching thing the issue for recognize that these are neighborhood this legitimate form urban development and that cities have engage these residents because they are building the cities the future thank you very much
