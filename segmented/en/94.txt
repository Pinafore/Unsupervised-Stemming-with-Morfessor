philosopher dan dennett call for religion all religion taught school can understand nature natural phenomenon then takes the purpose driven life claim that moral one must deny evolution god atheism brain cognitive science consciousness evolution philosophy religion dan dennett s response rick warren s wonderful back love this wonderful gathering and you must wonder what earth have they put the wrong slide look this magnificent beast and ask the question who designed this ted this technology entertainment design and there s dairy cow s quite wonderful designed animal and was thinking how introduce this and thought well maybe that old ggerel kilmer you know poem are made fool like but only god can make tree and you might say well god designed the cow but course god got lot help this the ancestor this the oryx and was designed natural selection the process natural selection over many millions years and then became domestic ated thousands years ago and human beings became steward and without even know what they were doing they gradual designed and designed and designed and then more recently they really began sort reverse engineering this beast and figure out just what the parts were how they worked and how they might optimize how they might made better now why talking about cows because want say that much the same thing true religions religions are natural phenomena they just natural cows they have evolved over mill ennia they have biological base just like the oryx they have become domestic ated and human beings have been designing their religions for thousands years this ted and want talk about design because what been doing for the last four years really since the first time you saw some you saw ted when was talking about religion and the last four years been working just about non stop this topic and you might say s about the reverse engineering religions now that very idea think strikes terror many people anger anxiety one sort another and that the spell that want break want say religions are important natural phenomenon should study them with the same intensity that study all the other important natural phenomena like global warming heard eloquent last night from gore today s religions are brilliant designed brilliant designed they immense powerful social institution and many their features can trace back earlier features that can really make sense reverse engineering and with the cow there s mixture evolutionary design designed natural selection itself and intelligent design more less intelligent design and designed human beings who are trying design their religions you don book talk ted but going have just one slide about book because there one message which think this group really needs hear and would very interested get your response this s the one policy proposal that make the book this time when claim not know enough about religion know what other policy proposal make and s one that echoes remark that you heard already today here s proposal going just take couple minutes explain education world religions world religions for all our children primary school high school public school private school and home school what proposing just require reading writing arithmetic american history should have curriculum fact about all the religions the world about their history about their creed about their text their music their symbol their prohibit ions their require ments and this should presented actually straight forward with particular all the children the country and long you teach them that you can teach them anything else you like that think tolerance for religious freedom long you form your children about other religions then you may and early you like and whatever you like teach them whatever creed you want them learn but also let them know about other religions now why say that because democracy depend informed citizen ship informed consent the very rock our understanding democracy informed consent not worth s like flip doesn count really democracy depend informed consent this the way treat people responsible adults now children below the age consent are special case going use word that pastor rick just used parents are steward their children they don own them you can own your children you have responsibility the world the state them take care them right you may teach them whatever creed you think most important but say you have responsibility let them informed about all the other creed the world too the reason taken this time been fascinated hear some the reaction this one review for catholic newspaper called totalitarian strikes practical liber arian totalitarian require reading writing and arithmetic don think all saying fact fact only value just fact about all the world s religions another review called hilarious well really bothered the fact that anybody would think that was hilarious seems such plausible natural extension the democratic principles already have that shocked think anybody would find that just ridiculous know many religions are ious about preserv the their faith among their children that they are tent keeping their children ignorant other faith don think that s defensible but really please get your answer that any reaction that later but now going move back the cow this picture which pulled off the web the fellow the left really important part this picture that s the steward cows couldn live without human steward they domestic ated they sort ectosymbiont they depend for their survival and pastor rick was just talking about sheep going talk about sheep too there s lot serendipitous convergence here how clever was sheep acquire shepherd think what this got them they could source all their problems protect from predators food finding health maintenance the only cost most flocks loss free mating what deal how clever sheep you might say except course wasn the sheep s clever ness all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists they not very smart wasn the clever ness the sheep all they were clue less but was very clever move whose clever move was was clever move natural selection itself francis crick the discover the structure dna with jim watson once joke about what called orgel s second rule orgel still molecular biologist brilliant guy and orgel s second rule evolution clever than you are now that not intelligent design not from francis crick evolution clever than you are you understand orgel s second rule then you understand why the intelligent design movement basically hoax the design discovered the process natural selection are brilliant unbeliev ably brilliant again and again biologist are fascinated with the brilliance what s discovered but the process itself without purpose without fore sight without design when was here four years ago told the story about ant climb blade grass and why was the ant doing well s because brain had been infected with lance fluke that was needed get into the belly sheep cow order produce was sort pooky story and think some people may have understood lance fluke aren smart submit that the intelligence lance fluke down there somewhere between petunia and carrot they not really bright they don have the lesson learn from this you don have have mind beneficiary the design there nature but s not anybody s head doesn have that s the way evolution works the question was domestic ation good for sheep was great for their genetic fitness and here want mind you wonderful point that paul ready made ted three years ago here s what said years ago the dawn agriculture human population plus live stock and pet was approximately tenth one per cent the terrestrial verteb landmass that was just years ago yesterday biological terms what today does anybody remember what told percent that what have done this planet now talked paul afterwards wanted check find out how calculate this and get the source and forth and gave paper that had written this there was passage which did not present here and think good going read you over billion years unique sphere chance has paint thin cover life complex improbable wonderful and fragile suddenly humans recently arrived species longer subject the check and balance inherent nature have grown population technology and intelligence position terrible power now wield the paintbrush heard about the atmosphere thin layer varnish life itself just thin paint this planet and the ones that hold the paintbrush and how can that the key our domi nation the planet culture and the key culture religion suppose martian scientists came earth they would puzzle many things anybody know what this tell you what this million people gathering the bank the gang perhaps the largest single gathering human beings ever seen from satellite photograph here s big crowd here s another crowd mecca martian would amazed this they want know how originate what was for and how perpetu ates itself actually going pass over this the ant isn alone there s all sorts wonderful case species that case parasite gets into mouse and needs get into the belly cat and turns the mouse into might mouse makes fear less runs out the open where cat true story other words have these you seen this slide before from four years ago parasite that fects the brain and duces even suicidal behavior behalf cause other than one s own genetic fitness does that ever happen yes does quite wonderful the arab word slam means mission means surrender self interest the will but not just talking about slam talking also about christian this ment music page that found paris books years ago and says latin est verb autem chris the word god the seed and the the seed chris same idea well not quite but fact christian too glory the fact that they have surrender god give you few quote the heart worship surrender surrender people obey god s words even doesn make sense those words are rick warren those are from the purpose driven life and want turn now briefly talk about that book which read you all got copy you just heard the man and what want now say bit about this book from the design stand point because think s actually brilliant book first all the goal and you heard just now what the goal s bring purpose the lives millions and has succeed good goal itself sure all agree wonderful goal s absolutely right there are lots people out there who don have purpose their life and bringing purpose their life wonderful goal give him this the goal achieve yes million copies this book gore eat your heart out just exactly what trying rick doing this fantastic achieve ment and the means how does s brilliant design traditional religious themes dating them quiet drop ping obsolete features putting new interpretation other features this the evolution religion that s been going for thousands years and s just the latest brilliant practitioner don have tell you this you just heard the man excellent sight into human psychology wise advice every page more over invite look under the hood really appreciate that for instance has appendix where explain his choice translation different bible verses the book clear vivid accessible beautiful form just enough petition that s really important every time you read say you make another copy your brain every time you read say you make another copy your brain with everybody every time you read say you make another copy your brain thank you and now come problem because absolutely since appreciation all that said about this book but wish were better have some problems with the book and would just since not address those problems wish could this with vision mark version his book the truth will set you free that s what says the bible and s something that want live too problem some the bit don think are true now some this difference opinion and that s not main complain that s worth mention here s passage s very much what said anyway there was god would all accident the result astronomical random chance the universe you could stop reading this book because life would have purpose meaning significance there would right wrong and hope beyond your brief years earth now just not believe that the way find home groen s film presented beautiful alternative that very claim yes there meaning and reason for right wrong don need belief god good have meaning but that just difference opinion that s not what really worried about how about this god designed this planet s environment just could live afraid that lot people take that sentiment mean that don have the sorts things that gore trying hard get not happy with that sentiment all and then find this all the evidence available the biological science support the core position that the cosmos especially designed whole with life and kind fundamental goal and purpose whole which all face reality have their meaning and explanation this central fact well that s michael s creation and here think wait minute read this again read three four times and think really endorsing intelligent design endorsing creation here and you can tell sort thinking well don know don know want get upset with this yet but then read and read this first had never seen rain because prior the flood god irrig ated the earth from the ground wish that sentence weren there because think false and think that thinking this way about the history the planet after just been hearing about the history the planet over millions years discourages people from scientific understanding now rick warren uses scientific terms and scientific fact oids and information very interesting way here s one god liber shaped and formed you serve him way that makes your ministry unique carefully mix the dna cocktail that created you think that s false now maybe want treat metaphor ical here s another one for instance your brain can store trillion fact your mind can handle decisions second well would interesting find the interpretation where would accept that there might some way treating that true anthropologist have not that worship universal urge hard wired god into the very fiber our being built need connect with god well there s sense which agree with him except think has evolutionary explanation and what find deeply troubling this book that seems arguing that you want moral you want have meaning your life you have intelligent designer you have deny the theory evolution natural selection and think the contrary that very important solving the world s problems that take evolutionary biology seriously whose truth are going listen well this from the purpose driven life the bible must become the author ative standard for life the pass re for direction the counsel listen for making wise decisions and the bench mark use for evalu ating everything well maybe but what s going follow from this and here s one that does concern remember quote him before with this line surrender people obey god s word even doesn make sense and that s problem don ever argue with the devil s better arguing than you are having had thousands years practice now rick warren didn invent this clever move s old move s very clever adaptation religions s wild card for any reasonable criticism you don like interpretation you got reasonable object don listen don listen that s the devil speaking this discourages the sort reason citizen ship seems that want have got one more problem then through and really like get response rick able the great commission jesus said all people all nations and make them disciples bapt them the name the father the and the holy spirit and teach them everything told you the bible says jesus the only one who can save the world now here seen many wonderful map the world the last day here s one not beautiful the others simply shows the religions the world and here s one that shows the sort current break down the different religions now really want commit ourselves engulf all the other religions when their holy books are telling them don listen the other side that s just satan talking seems that that s very problem atic ship get for the future found this sign was driving main recently front church good without god becomes zero sort cute very clever little don believe and think this idea popular not this guise but general itself one the main problems that face you are like you know many wonderful commit engage atheist agnostics who are being very good without god and you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanct instead doing good works wish could drop this wish this would extinct thanks very much for your attention
