given billion spend which would you solve first aids global warming political scientist bjorn lomborg comes with surprising answer aids africa business choice climate change culture disaster relief economics environment future global issues poverty bjorn lomborg set global priorities what like talk about really the biggest problems the world not going talk about the skeptic environmental probably that s also good choice but going talk about what are the big problems the world and must say before should ask every one you try and get out pen and paper because actually going ask you help look how that get out your pen and paper bottom line there lot problems out there the world just going list some them there are million people starving there s billion people without clean drink water two billion people without sanitation there are several million people dying hiv and aids the lists and there s two billion people who will severe affected climate change there are many many problems out there deal world would solve them all but don don actually solve all problems and not the question think need ask ourselves and that s why s the economy session say don all things really have start asking ourselves which ones should solve first and that s the question like ask you had say billion dollars over the next four years spend good this world where should spend identified the biggest challenge the world and will just briefly read them climate change communicable diseases conflict education financial stability governance and corruption malnutrition and hunger population migration sanitation and water and subsidies and trade barrier believe that these many ways encompass the biggest problems the world the obvious question would ask what you think are the biggest things where should start solving these problems but that s wrong problem ask that was actually the problem that was asked january but course there s problem asking people focus problems because can solve problems sure the biggest problem have the world that all die but don have technology solve that right the point not prioritize problems but the point prioritize solutions problems and that would course that gets little more complicated climate change that would like kyoto communicable diseases might health clinic mosqui nets conflict would s peace keeping forces and the point that would like ask you try just seconds and know this sense impossible task write down what you think probably some the top priorities and also and that s course where economics gets evil put down what are the things should not first what should the bottom the list please just take seconds perhaps talk your neighbor and just figure out what should the top priorities and the bottom priorities the solutions that have the world s biggest issues the amazing part this process and course mean would love only have minutes already given you quite substantial amount time right love into and get you think about this process and that s actually what did and also strongly encourage you and sure also have these discussion afterwards think about how actually prioritize course you have ask yourself why earth was such list never done before and one reason that prioritization incredibly comfortable nobody want this course every organization would love the top such list but every organization would also hate not the top the list and since there are many more not number one spot the list than there number ones makes perfect sense not want such list had the for almost years yet never actually made fundamental list all the big things that can the world and said which them should first doesn mean that are not prioritizing any decision prioritization course are still prioritizing only implic and that s unlike good actually did the prioritization and went and talked about what proposing really say that have for very long time had situation when had menu choice there are many many things can out there but not had the price nor the size have not had idea imagine going into restaurant and getting this big menu card but you have idea what the price you know you have pizza you idea what the price could one dollar could dollars could family size pizza could very individual size pizza right like know these things and that what the copenhagen consensus really trying try put price these issues and basically this has been the copenhagen consensus process got the world s best economists three each area have three world s top economists write about climate change what can what will the cost and what will the benefit that like wise communicable diseases three the world s top experts saying what can what would the price what should about and what will the come and then had some the world s top economists eight the world s top economists including three nobel laureate meet copenhagen may called them the dream team the cambridge university fects decided call them the real economics that works very well europe but doesn really work over here and what they basically did was come out with prioritize list and then you ask why economists and course very happy you asked that question because that s very good question the point course you want know about malaria you ask malaria expert you want know about climate you ask clim atologist but you want know which the two you should deal with first you can ask either them because that s not what they that what economists they prioritize they make that some ways disgust task saying which one should first and which one should afterwards this the list and this the one like share with you course you can also see the website and also talk about more sure the day goes they basically came with list where they said there were bad projects basically projects where you invest dollar you get less than dollar back then there s fair projects good projects and very good projects and course s the very good projects should start doing going from backwards that end with the best projects these were the bad projects you might see the bottom the list was climate change this lot people and that s probably one the things where people will say shouldn come back either and like talk about that because that s really curious why came and actually also try get back this because s probably one the things that disagree with the list that you wrote down the reason why they came with saying that kyoto doing something more than kyoto bad deal simply because s very efficient s not saying that global warming not happening s not saying that s not big problem but s saying that what can about very little very high cost what they basically show the average all macro economic models that kyoto everyone agreed would cost about billion dollars year that s substantial amount money that s two three times the global development aid that give the third world every year yet would very little good all models show will postpone warming for about six years the guy bangladesh who gets flood can wait until which little good but not very much good the idea here really say well spent lot money doing little good and just give you sense reference the actually estimate that for half that amount for about billion dollars year could solve all major basic problems the world could give clean drink water sanitation basic healthcare and education every single human being the planet have ask ourselves want spend twice the amount doing very little good half the amount doing amazing amount good and that really why becomes bad project s not say that had all the money the world wouldn want but s say when don s just simply not our first priority the fair projects notice not going comment all these but communicable diseases scale basic health service just made simply because yes scale basic health service great thing would lot good but s also very very cost again what tells suddenly start thinking about both side the equation you look the good projects lot sanitation and water projects came again sanitation and water incredibly important but also cost lot infrastructure like show you the top four priorities which should least the first ones that deal with when talk about how should deal with the problems the world the fourth best problem malaria dealing with malaria the incidence malaria about couple million people get infected every year might even cost towards percentage point gdp every year for affected nations invest about billion dollars over the next four years could bring that incidence down half could avoid about people dying but perhaps more important could avoid about million people getting infected every year would significant increase their ability deal with many the other problems that they have deal with course the long run also deal with global warming this third best one was free trade basically the model showed that could get free trade and especially cut subsidies the s and europe could basically enliven the global economy astound number about billion dollars year half which would accrue the third world again the point say that could actually pull two three hundred million people out poverty very radical fast about two five years that would the third best thing could the second best thing would focus malnutrition not just malnutrition general but there s very cheap way dealing with malnutrition namely the lack micro nutrients basically about half the world s population lack iron zinc iodine and vitam invest about billion dollars could make severe road into that problem that would the second best investment that could and the very best project would focus hiv aids basically invest billion dollars over the next eight years could avoid new million case hiv aids again what this does and what focus saying there are two very different ways that can deal with hiv aids one treatment the other one prevention and again deal world would both but world where don either don very well have least ask ourselves where should invest first and treatment much much more expensive than prevention basically what this focus saying can lot more invest prevention basically for the amount money that spend can amount good treatment and times much good prevention again what focus prevention rather than treatment first rate what this really does that makes think about our priorities like have you look your priority list and say did you get right did you get close what came with here well course one the things climate change again find lot people find very very unlike that should that should also climate change for other reason simply because s such big problem but course don all problems there are many problems out there the world and what want make sure actually focus problems that focus the right ones the ones where can lot good rather than little good and think actually thomas schelling one the participant the dream team put very very well one things that people that years when talking about most the climate change impact will people will much much richer even the most pessimistic impact scenarios the estimate that the average person the developing world will about rich are today much more likely they will two four times richer than are and course even richer than that but the point say when talk about saving people helping people bangladesh not talking about poor bangladesh actually talking about fairly rich dutch guy and the real point course say want spend lot money helping little years from now fairly rich dutch guy want help real poor people right now bangladesh who really need the help and whom can help very very cheaply schelling put imagine you were rich you will rich chinese rich bolivian rich congo thinking back and saying how odd that they cared much about helping little bit through climate change and cared fairly little about helping grandfather and great grandfather whom they could have helped much more and who needed the help much more think that really does tell why need get our priorities straight even doesn cord the typical way see this problem course that s mainly because climate change has good pictures have you know the day after tomorrow looks great right s good film the sense that certainly want see right but don expect rich cast bra his next movie ging latrine tanzania something just doesn make for much movie many ways think the copenhagen consensus and the whole discussion priorities defense for boring problems make sure that realize s not about making feel good s not about making things that have the most media attention but s about making places where can actually the most good the other object ions think that are important say that somehow are somehow false choice course should all things deal world would certainly agree think should all things but don the developed world decided were going spend twice much did right now than the developing world since then our aid has halve doesn look like actually the path suddenly solving all big problems like wise people are also saying but what about the iraq war you know spend billion dollars why don spend that doing good the world all for that any one you guys can talk bush into doing that that s fine but the point course still say you get another billion dollars still want spend that the best possible way don the real issue here get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities should just mention briefly this really the right list that got out you know when you ask the world s best economists you inevit ably end asking old white american men and they not necessarily you know great ways looking the entire world actually invited young people from all over the world come and solve the same problem the only two require ments were that they were studying the university and they spoke english the majority them were first from developing countries they had all the same material but they could vast outside the scope discussion and they certainly did come with their own lists and the surprising thing was that the list was very similar with malnutrition and diseases the top and climate change the bottom done this many other times there s been many other seminar and university students and different things they all come out with very much the same list and that gives great hope really saying that believe that there path ahead get start thinking about priorities and saying what the important thing the world course deal world again love everything but don then can start thinking about where should start see the copenhagen consensus process did and hope assemble many more people getting much better information for map out the right path for the world but also start thinking about political start thinking about saying let s not the things where can very little very high cost not the things that don know how but let s the great things where can enormous amount good very low cost right now the end the day you can disagree with the discussion how actually prioritize these but have honest and frank about saying there s some things there are other things don worry too much about some things end not worry about other things hope this will help make better priorities and think about how better work for the world thank you
