storytelling jehane noujaim wishes for global day film can help but with this wish think about when you little kid and you all your friends ask you could give you one wish the world what would and always answer well want the wish have the wisdom know exactly what wish for well then you screwed because you know what wish for and you used your wish and now since only have one wish unlike last year they had three wishes not going wish for that let s get what would like which world peace and know what you thinking you thinking the poor girl there she think she s beauty page she s not she s the ted prize but really think makes sense and think that the first step world peace for people meet each other met lot different people over the years and film some them from executive new york that wanted take over the world military press office qatar that would rather not take over the world you seen the film control room that was sent out you understand little bit why thank you wow some you watched that s great that s great basically what like talk about today way for people travel meet people different way than because you can travel all over the world the same time and long time ago well about years ago mom had exchange student and going show you slides the exchange student this donna this donna the statue liber this mother and aunt teaching donna how ride bike this donna eating ice cream and this donna teaching aunt how filipino dance now really think the world getting smaller becomes more and more important that learn each other s dance move that meet each other get know each other are able figure out way cross borders understand each other understand people s hope and dream what makes them laugh and cry and know that can all exchange program and can force everybody travel already talked about that chris and and they said that there s problem with this you can force people free will and totally support that not forcing people travel but like talk about another way travel that doesn require ship airplane and just require movie camera project and screen and that s what going talk you about today was asked that speak little bit about where personally come from and cameron don know how you managed get out that one but think that building bridge important because where come from the daughter american mother and egyptian lebanese syrian father the living product two culture coming together pun intended and also been called egyptian lebanese syrian american with persian name the middle east peace crisis maybe starting take pictures was some kind way bring both side family together way take the world with way tell stories visual all kind started that way but think that really realized the power the image when first went the garbage collect village egypt when was about mother took there she s somebody that believe strongly community service and decided that this was something that needed and went there and met some amazing women there there was center there where they were teaching people how read and write and get vacci nations against the many diseases you can get from sort through garbage and began start teaching there taught english and met some incredible women there met people that live seven people room barely can afford their evening meal yet live with this strength spirit and sense humor and just incredible qualities got drawn into this community and began take pictures there took pictures dding and older family member things that they wanted memories about two years after started taking these pictures the conference population and development asked show them the conference was was very excited was first exhibit photograph and they were all put there and after about two days they all came down except for three people were very upset very angry that was showing these dirty side cairo and why didn cut the dead out the frame and there got very depressed looked this big empty wall with three lonely photograph that were you know very pretty photograph and was like failed this but was looking this intense emotion and intense feeling that had come out people just seeing these photograph mean here was this year old pipsqueak that nobody listened and all sudden put these photograph the wall and there were argument and they had taken down and just saw the power the image and was incredible and think the most important reaction that saw there was actually people that would never have gone the garbage village themselves that would never have seen that the human spirit could thrive such difficult circumstances and think was that point that decided that wanted use photography and film somehow bridge gap bridge culture bring people together cross borders and that s what really kind started off did stint made film called start com and done couple music film but when the war iraq was about start was very real feeling for because before the war started there was kind this media war that was going and was watching television new york and there seemed just one point view that was coming across and the cover went from the s state department embedded troops and what was coming across the news was that there was going this clean war and precision bomb and the iraq would greeting the americans liber ators and throw flower their feet the streets baghdad and knew that there was completely other story that was taking place the middle east where parents were knew that there was completely other story being told and was thinking how are people supposed communicate with each other when they getting completely different message and nobody know what the other s being told how are people supposed have any kind common understanding know how move together into the future knew that had there just wanted the center had plan had funding didn even have camera the time had somebody bring there because wanted get access jazeera george bush s favorite channel and place which was very curious about because s liked many government across the arab world and also called the mouth piece osama bin laden some people the s government was thinking you know this station that s hat many people has doing something right got see what this all about and also wanted see central comm which was minutes away and that way could get access how this news was being created the arab side reaching the arab world and the s and western side reaching the s and when went there and there and met these people that were the center and with these character met some surprising very complex people and like share with you little bit that experience when you with somebody and you film them and you listen them and you allow them more than five second sound bite the amazing complexity people emerge same khader business usual iraq and then iraq and then iraq but between offered job with fox take change the arab nightmare into the american dream still have that dream maybe will never able but have plans for children when they finish their high school will send them america study there will pay for their study and they will stay there josh rush the night they showed the pow and the dead soldiers jazeera showed them was powerful because america doesn show those kinds images most the news america won show really images and this showed american soldiers uniform strewn about floor cold tile floor and was revolting was absolutely revolting made sick stomach and then what hit was the night before there had been some kind bomb basra and jazeera had shown images the people and they were equally not more horr the images were and remember having seen the jazeera office and thought myself wow that s gross that s bad and then going away and probably eating dinner something and didn affect much the impact had realizing that just saw people the other side and those people the jazeera office must have felt the way was feeling that night and upset profound level that wasn bothered much the night before makes hate war but doesn make believe that world that can live without war yet jehane noujaim was overwhelm the response the film for didn know whether would able get out there had funding for were incredibly lucky that got picked and when showed the film both the united states and the arab world had such incredible reaction was amazing see how people were moved this film the arab world and s not really the film s the character mean josh rush was this incredibly complex person who was thinking about things and when showed the film the middle east people wanted meet josh kind redefine american population people started you know ask where this guy now jazeera offered him job and same the other hand was also quite interesting character for the arab world see because brought out the complex ities this love hate relationship that the arab world has with the west the united states was blown away the motivation the positive motivation the american people when they see this film you know criticize broad for believing the saviors the world some way but the flip side that actually when people see what happening broad and people s reaction some our policy broad feel this power that need feel like have get the power change things and saw this with audience this woman came after the screen and said you know know this crazy saw the bomb being loaded the planes saw the military going out war but you don understand people s anger towards until you see the people the hospital and the victims the war and how get out this bubble how understand what the other person thinking now don know whether film can change the world but know that starts know the power know that starts people thinking about how change the world now not philosopher feel like shouldn into great depth this but let film speak for itself and take you this other world because believe that film has the ability take you across borders like you just back and experience for couple minutes being taken into another world and these couple clip take you inside two the most difficult conflict that are faced with today man long there justice someone must make sacrifice woman that s sacrifice that s revenge you kill there s difference between victim and occupier man had airplanes wouldn need martyrs that s the difference woman the difference that the israel military still strong man then let equal death still have paradise woman there paradise only exists your head man god may god give you you were not abu azzam s daughter anyway rather have paradise head than live this hell this life dead anyway one only choose bitterness when the alternative even woman and what about the ones who remain will win that way don you see what you doing destroying and that you give israel alibi carry man with alibi israel will stop woman perhaps have turn into moral war man how israel has moral woman careful zvika wife ayelet called and said there was suicide bomb tel aviv ayelet what you know about the casual ties looking for three girls zvika have information ayelet one wounded here but haven heard from the other three zvika said that s bat chen that s daughter are you sure she

fire and year old daughter chris was killed the shooting the head master for all parts george but there teacher that charge zvika yes have assist ants deal with children all the time george first thought was strange idea but after thinking logical about didn find any reason why not meet them and let them know our suffering george there were many things that touched see that there are palestinian who suffer lot who lost children and still believe the peace process and reconciliation who lost what most precious can talk each other and look forward better future then everyone else must too man song something that communicate with people who otherwise would not have understood where coming from you could give them long political speech they would still not understand but tell you when you finish that song people will like damn know where you niggaz are coming from know where you guys are coming from death apartheid narrator s about the liber ation struggle s about those children who took the streets fighting cream free nelson mandela s about those union who put down their tools and demand freedom yes yes freedom jehane noujaim think everybody s had that feeling sitting theater dark room with other strangers watching very powerful film and they felt that feeling transformation what like talk about how can use that feeling actually create movement through film been listening the talk some the conference and robert wright said yesterday that have appreciation for another person s humanity then they will have appreciation for our and that s what this about s about connecting people through film getting these independent voices out there now josh rush actually ended leaving the military and taking job with jazeera his feeling that s jazeera international because feel like can actually use media bridge the gap between east and west and that s amazing thing but been trying think about ways give power these independent voices give power the film makers give power people who are trying use film for change and there are incredible organization that are out there doing this already there s witness that you heard from earlier there s just vision that are working with palestinian and israel who are working together for peace and document that process and getting interview out there and using this film take congress show that s powerful tool show that this woman who s had her daughter killed attack and she believe that there are peace ways solve this there s working film and there s current which incredible platform for people around the world
