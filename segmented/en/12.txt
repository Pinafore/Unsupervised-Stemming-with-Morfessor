eva vertes only when she gave this talk discuss her journey toward studying medicine and her drive understand the roots cancer and alzheimer s featured cancer disease health science technology under eva vertes looks the future medicine thank you s really honor and privilege here spend last day teenager today want talk you about the future but first going tell you bit about the past story start way before was born grandmother was train auschwitz the death camp and she was going along the track and the track split and somehow don really know exactly the whole story but the train took the wrong track and went work camp rather than the death camp grandmother survive and married grand father they were living hungary and mother was born and when mother was two years old the hungarian revolution was aging and they decided escape hungary they got boat and yet another diverg the boat was either going canada australia they got and didn know where they were going and ended canada make long story short they came canada grandmother was chemist she worked the bant institute and she die cancer never met grandmother but carry her name her exact name eva vertes and like think carry her scientific passion too found this passion not far from here actually when was nine years old family was road trip and were the grand canyon and had never been reader when was young dad had tried with the hard boy tried nancy drew tried all that and just didn like reading book and mother bought this book when were the grand canyon called the hot was all about the break the ebola virus and something about just kind drew toward there was this big sort bump looking virus the over and just wanted read pick that book and from the edge the grand canyon big sur and actually here where are today monterey read that book and from when was reading that book knew that wanted have life medicine wanted like the explo read about the book who went into the jungles africa went into the research lab and just tried figure out what this dead virus was from that moment read every medical book could get hands and just love much was pass observ the medical world wasn until entered high school that thought maybe now you know being big high school kid can maybe become active part this big medical world was and email professor the local university see maybe could work their lab and hard anyone respond but mean why would they respond year old anyway and got talk one professor jacobs who accepted into the lab that time was really interested neuro science and wanted research project neuro specific looking the effect heavy metals the develop nervous system started that and worked his lab for year and found the result that guess you expect find when you feed fru lies heavy metals that really really impaired the nervous system the spinal cord had break the neuron were cross every which way and from then wanted look not impairment but preventi impairment that s what led alzheimer s started reading about alzheimer s and tried familiar myself with the research and the same time when was the was reading the medical library one day and read this article about something called purine derivative and they seemed have cell growth promoting properties and being about the whole field kind thought you have cell death alzheimer s which using the memory defic and then you have this compound purine derivative that are promoting cell growth and thought maybe can promote cell growth can inhibit cell death too and that s the project that pursue for that year and s continu now well and found that specific purine derivative called guanidine had inhibit the cell growth approximate percent present those result the inter national science which was just one the most amazing experience life and there was award best the world medicine which allowed get least get foot the door the big medical world and from then since was now this huge exciting world wanted explo all wanted all once but knew couldn really get that and stumbled across something called cancer stem cells and this really what want talk you about today about cancer first when heard cancer stem cells didn really know how put the two together heard stem cells and heard them the panacea the future the therapy many disease come the future perhaps but heard cancer the most fear disease our time how did the good and bad together last summer worked university doing some research cancer stem cells and while was doing this was reading the cancer literature trying again familiar myself with this new medical field and seemed that tumors actually begin from stem cell this fascinated the more read the more looked cancer different and almost became less fear seems that cancer direct result injury you smoke you damage your lung tissue and then lung cancer arises you drink you damage your liver and then liver cancer occur and was really interesting there were articles correlat you have bone fracture and then bone cancer arises because what stem cells are they these phenomena cells that really have the ability differentiate into any type tissue the body sensing that you have damage organ and then s initiating cancer s almost this repair response and the cancer the body saying the lung tissue damage need repair the lung and cancer originat the lung trying repair because you have this excessi pro ation these remarkable cells that really have the potential become lung tissue but s almost the body has originat this ing enious response but can quite control has yet become fine tune enough finish what has been this really really fascinated and really think that can think about cancer let alone any disease such black and white terms eliminate cancer the way trying now with chemo therapy and radiation bombard the body the cancer with toxins with radiation trying kill s almost getting back this starting point moving the cancer cells but revealing the previous damage that the body has tried fix shouldn think about manipu ation rather than elimination somehow can cause these cells differentiate become bone tissue lung tissue liver tissue what that cancer has been put there would repair process end better than were before cancer this really changed view looking cancer and while was reading all these articles about cancer seemed that the articles lot them focus you know the genetic breast cancer and the genes and the progression breast cancer track the cancer through the body trac where where goes but truck that never heard cancer the heart cancer any skeletal muscle for that matter and skeletal muscle constitutes percent our body over percent our body and first kind thought well maybe there s some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn get cancer least not that know looked further into found many articles could and was amazing because turned out that was very rare some articles even went far say that skeletal muscle tissue resistant cancer and further not only cancer but metastases going skeletal muscle and what metastases are when the tumor when piece break off and travel through the blood stream and goes different organ that s what metastasis s the part cancer that the most dangerous cancer was local could likely move somehow you know s contained s very contained but once start moving through the body that s when become dead the fact that not only did cancer not seem originat skeletal muscle but cancer didn seem skeletal muscle there seemed something here these articles were saying you know skeletal metastasis skeletal muscle very rare but was left that one seemed ask why decided ask why first the first thing did was email some professor who special skeletal muscle physio and pretty much said hey seems like cancer doesn really skeletal muscle there reason for this and lot the lies got were that muscle terminally differentiate tissue meaning that you have muscle cells but they not dividing doesn seem like good for cancer hijack but then again this fact that the metastases didn skeletal muscle made that seem unlike and further that nervous tissue brain gets cancer and brain cells are also terminally differentiate decided ask why and here s some guess hypotheses that starting investigate this may the sylvester cancer institute miami and guess keep investigating until get the answer but know that science once you get the answer evita you going have more question guess you could say that probably doing this for the rest life some hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle there s lot blood vessels going skeletal muscle and the first thing that makes think that blood vessels are like highway for the tumor cells tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels and you think the more highway there are tissue the more likely get cancer get metastases first all thought you know would favor cancer getting skeletal muscle and well cancer tumors require process called angiogenesis which really the tumor recruit the blood vessels self supply self with nutrients can grow without angiogenesis the tumor remain the size point and s not harmful angiogenesis really central process the patho genes cancer and one article that really stood out when was just reading about this trying figure out why cancer doesn skeletal muscle was that had reported percent micro metastases skeletal muscle autopsy percent meaning that there were these point tumors skeletal muscle but only percent actual metastases suggest that maybe skeletal muscle able control the angiogenesis able control the tumors recruit these blood vessels use skeletal muscle much s the one port our body our heart s always always moving our muscle possible that muscle somehow intuitive know that needs this blood supply needs constantly contract therefore s almost self s grabb it blood vessels for self therefore when tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue can get blood supply and can grow this suggest that maybe there anti angiogenic fact skeletal muscle perhaps even more angiogenic fact can actually direct where the blood vessels grow this could potential future therapy for cancer and another thing that s really interesting that there s this whole the way tumors move through the body s very complex system and there s something called the chemokine work and chemokine are essential chemical attractants and they the stop and signals for cancer tumor express chemokine receptor and another organ distant organ somewhere the body will have the respond chemokine and the tumor will see these chemokine and rate toward possible that skeletal muscle doesn express this type molecules and the other really interesting thing that when skeletal muscle there s been several reports that when skeletal muscle injured that s what correlat with metastases going skeletal muscle and further when skeletal muscle injured that s what cause chemokine these signals saying cancer you can come the sign for the tumors cause them high express these chemokine there s much inter here mean there are many possi bilities for why tumors don skeletal muscle but seems like investigating attack cancer search where cancer not there has got something there s got something that s making this tissue resistant tumors and can util can take this pro this compound this receptor what that s control these anti tumor properties and apply cancer therapy general now one thing that kind tie the resistance skeletal muscle cancer the cancer repair response gone out control the body that skeletal muscle has fact called myod and what myod essential does cause cells differentiate into muscle cells this compound myod has been test lot different cell type and been show actually convert this variety cell type into skeletal muscle cells possible that the tumor cells are going the skeletal muscle tissue but once contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue myod act these tumor cells and cause them become skeletal muscle cells maybe tumor cells are being guised skeletal muscle cells and this why seems rare s not harmful has just repair the muscle muscle constantly being used constantly being damage every time muscle every time stretched muscle move wrong way cancer occurred mean everybody would have cancer almost and hate say that but seems though muscle cell possibly because all it use has adapt faster than other body tissue respond injury fine tune this repair response and actually able finish the process which the body want finish really believe that the human body very very smart and can counter something the body saying s different when bacteria comes into the body that s foreign object want that out but when the body actually initiating process and call disease doesn seem though elimination the right solution even from there s possible although far fetched that the future could almost think cancer being used therapy those disease where tissue are deter iorat for example alzheimer s where the brain the brain cells die and need rest new brain cells new function brain cells what could the future use cancer tumor put the brain and cause differentiate into brain cells that s very far fetched idea but really believe that may possible these cells are versatile these cancer cells are versatile just have manipu them the right way and again some these may far fetched but figured there s where present far fetched ideas s here ted thank you very much
