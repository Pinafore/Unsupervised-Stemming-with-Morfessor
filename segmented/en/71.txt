meet lot people who are very smart and say but why can figure out problems and meet lot people who are very successful who say why don feel more fulfill why feel like fake why feel like got pretend that more than really think that comes down this issue meaning significance purpose think comes down this issue why here what here for where going these are not religious issues they human issues wanted tell michael before spoke that really appreciate what does because makes life work whole lot easier pastor see lot kooks and have learned that there are kooks every area life religion doesn have monopoly that but there are plenty religious kooks there are ular kooks there are smart kooks dumb kooks there are people lady came the other day and she had white piece paper michael you like this one and she said what you see and looked and said don see anything and she goes well see jesus and started cry and left going you know fine good for you when the book became the best selling book the world for the last three years kind had little crisis and that was what the purpose this because brought enormous amount money when you write the best selling book the world s tons and tons money and brought lot attention neither which wanted when started saddle back church was years old started with one other family and decided that was never going because didn want celebrity didn want quote evange list evange list that s not thing and all sudden brought lot money and lot attention don think now this worldview and will tell you everybody s got worldview everybody s betting their life something you betting your life something you just better know why you betting what you betting everybody s betting their life something and when you know made happened believe that jesus was who said was but everybody s got and believe plural istic society everybody s betting something and when started the church you know had plans what s doing now and then when wrote this book and all sudden just took off then started saying now what s the purpose this because started say don think you given money fame for your own ego ever just don believe that and when you write book that the first sentence the book s not about you then when all sudden becomes the best selling book history you got figure well guess s not about that s kind brain what for and began think about what call the stewardship affluence and the stewardship influence believe essentially that leadership stewardship that you are leader any area business politics sports art academic any area you don own you are steward for instance that s why believe protect the environment this not planet wasn mine before was born s not going mine after die just here for years and then that s was debat the other day talk show and the guy was challeng and what s pastor doing protect the environment and asked this guy said well you believe that human beings are responsible make the world little bit better place for the next generation you think have stewardship here take the environment seriously and said said you don said let make this clear again you believe that human beings not talking about religion you believe that human beings our responsibility take care this planet and make just little bit better for the next generation and said not any more than any other species when said the word species was revealing his worldview and was saying more responsible take care this environment than duck well now know lot times act like duck but you not duck you not duck and you are responsible that s worldview and you need understand what your worldview the problem most people never really think through they never really qualify quant and say this what believe this why believe what believe don personally have enough faith atheist but you may you may your worldview though does determine everything else your life because determines your decisions determines your relationship determines your level confidence determines really everything your life what believe obviously and you know this determines our behavior and our behavior determines what become life all this money started pour and all this fame started pour and what with this wife and first made five decisions what with the money said first not going use ourselves didn out and buy bigger house don own guest house still drive the same four year old for that driven just said not going use the second thing was stopped taking salary from the church that pastor third thing added all that the church had paid over the last years and gave back and gave back because didn want anybody thinking that what for money don fact personally never met priest pastor minister who does for money know that s stereo type never met one them believe there s whole lot easier ways make money pastor are like hours day call they like doctors left late today hope here yesterday because father law his last probably hours before die cancer and watching guy who s lived his life s now his mid s and s dying with peace you know the test your worldview not how you act the good times the test your worldview how you act the funeral and having been through literally hundreds not thousands funeral makes difference makes difference what you believe gave all back and then set three foundation working some the major problems the world literacy poverty pandemic diseases particularly hiv aids and set these three foundation and put the money into that the last thing did became what call reverse tithers and that when wife and got married years ago started thing now that s principle the bible that says give percent what you get back charity give away help other people started doing that and each year would raise our percent our first year marriage went percent second year went percent and the third year went percent and and and why did that because every time give break the grip material life material all about getting get get get get all you can can all you get the can and spoil the rest s all about more having more and think that the good life actually looking good that s most important all looking good feeling good and having the good but that s not the good life meet people all the time who have those and they not necessarily happy money actually made you happy then the wealth iest people the world would the happiest and that know personally know not true s just not true the good life not about looking good feeling good having the good s about being good and doing good giving your life away significance life doesn come from status because you can always find somebody who s got more than you doesn come from sex doesn come from salary comes from serving giving our lives away that find meaning find significance that s the way were wired believe god and began give away and now after years wife and are reverse tithers give away percent and live that actually was the easy part the hard part what with all this attention because start getting all kinds invitation just came off nearly month long speaking tour three different continent and won into that but was amazing thing and going what with this oriety that the book has brought and being pastor started reading the bible there s chapter the bible called psalm and s solo s prayer for more influence when you read this prayer sounds incredibly selfish self center sounds like says god want you make famous that s what pray says want you make famous want you spread the fame name through every land want you give power want you make famous want you give influence and just sounds like the most egotistical quest you could make you were going pray until you read the whole psalm the whole chapter and then says that the king was the king israel that time apex power that the king may care for the widow and orphan support depressed defend the defense less care for the sick assist the poor speak for the foreign those prison basically s talking about all the margin ized society and read that looked and thought you know what this saying that the purpose influence speak for those who have influence the purpose influence not build your ego your net worth and the way your net worth not the same thing your self worth your value not based your valuable s based whole different set things and the purpose influence speak for those who have influence and had admit can think the last time thought widow and orphan they not radar pastor church one the most affluent areas america bunch gated communities have church full ceo and scientists and could five years and never ever see home less person they just not pathway now they miles the road santa had say would use whatever affluence and whatever influence got help those who don have either those you know there s story the bible about moses whether you believe s true not really didn matter but moses you saw the movie the ten commandments moses goes out and there s this burning bush and god talk him and god says moses what s your hand think that s one the most important questions you ever asked what s your hand moses says s staff s shepherd s staff and god says throw down and you saw the movie you know throw down and becomes snake and then god says pick and pick back again and becomes staff again now reading this thing and going what that all about what s that all about well know couple things number one god never does miracle show off s not just wow isn that cool and the way god doesn have show cheese bread you know god s going show s not going show cheese bread just this why love what michael does because s like s bunk then don have but god god doesn show sprinkler images got few more powerful ways than that whatever want but doesn miracle just show off second thing god ever asks you question already know the answer obviously s god then that would mean that when asks the question s for your benefit not his s going what s your hand now what was moses hand well was shepherd s staff now follow this this staff represent three things about moses life first represent his identity was shepherd s the symbol his own occupation shepherd s symbol his identity his career his job second s symbol not only his identity s symbol his income because all his assets are tied sheep those days nobody had bank account american express cards edge fund your assets are tied your flocks s symbol his identity and s symbol his income and the third thing s symbol his influence what you with shepherd s staff well you know you move sheep from point point with hook crook you pull them you poke them one the other s saying you going lay down your identity what s your hand you got identity you got income you got influence what s your hand and s saying you lay down make come alive some things you could never imagine possible and you watched that movie ten commandments all those big miracle that happen egypt are done through this staff last year was invited speak nba all stars game and talking the players because most the nba team team and all the other team have done this days purpose based the book and asked them said what s your hand what s your hand said s basket ball and that basket ball represent your identity who you are you nba player represent your income you making lot money off that little ball and represent your influence and even though you only going the nba for few years you going nba player for the rest your life and that gives with you enormous influence what are you going with what you been given and guess that s the main reason came here today all you very bright people ted say what s your hand what you have that you been given talent background education freedom network opportunities wealth ideas creativity what are you doing with what you been given that the primary question about life that what being purpose driven all about the book talk about how you wired certain things you shaped this little cross takes spiritual gift heart ability personal and experience these things shape you and you want know what you ought doing with your life you need look your shape what wired why would god wire you something and then not have you you wired anthropologist you anthropologist you wired under explorer you under explorer you wired make deal you make deal you wired paint you paint did you know that god smile when you you when little kids were little they all grown now have grand kids used and the side their bed and used watch kids sleep and just watched their little bodies rise and lower rise and lower and would look them this not accident rise and lower and got joy out just watching them sleep some people have the guide idea that god only gets excited when you doing quote spiritual things like going church helping the poor you know confess doing something like that the bottom line god gets pleasure watching you you why made you and when you what you were made goes that s boy that s girl you using the talent and ability that gave you advice you look what s your hand your identity your influence your income and say s not about s about making the world better place thank you
