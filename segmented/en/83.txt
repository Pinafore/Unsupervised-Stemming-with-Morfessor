wilson accept his ted prize makes plea behalf all creatures that learn more about our biosphere and build network encyclopedia all the world s knowledge about life ted prize ants biodiversity biology biosphere global issues nature science technology wilson saving life earth have all life wonder what mind boggl meant after two days here declar myself boggl and enormous impress and feel that you are one the great hope not just for american achieve ment science and technology but for the whole world come however special mission behalf constituency which are the the power that s million trillion insects and other small creatures and make plea for them were wipe out insects alone just that group alone this planet which are trying hard the rest life and humanity with would mostly disappear from the land and within few months now how did come this particular position advocacy little boy and through teen years became increasing fascinated the diversity life had period snake period bird period fish period cave period and finally and definitive ant period college years was devoted rmecologist special the biology ants but attention and research continued make journey across the great variety life earth general including all that means species how little understand and how press danger that our activities have created for out that broad study has emerged concern and ambition crystallize the wish that about make you choice the culmi nation life time commitment that began with growing the gulf coast alabama the florida peninsula far back can remember was chant the natural beauty that region and the almost tropical exuberance the plants and animals that grow there one day when was only seven years old and fish pulled fish they called with sharp spine too hard and fast and blind myself one eye later discovered was also hard hearing possibly genital the upper register planning profession natural never considered anything else entire life found that was lousy bird watching and couldn track frog call either turned the small creatures that can held between the thumb and fore finger the little things that compose the foundation our ecosystem the little things like say who run the world doing reached front biology strange rich that seemed though exists another planet fact live mostly explore planet the great majority organisms earth remain unknown science the last years thanks exploration remote parts the world and advance technology biologist have for example added full one third the known frog and other amphibian species bring the current total and more continue pour two new kinds whale have been discovered along with two new antelopes dozen monkey species and new kind elephant and even distinct kind gorilla the extreme opposite end the size scale the class marine bacteria the prochlorococci that will the final exam although discovered only are now recognize likely the most abundant organisms earth and more over responsible for large part the photo synthesis that occur the ocean these bacteria were not covered sooner because they are also among the small all earth s organisms minute that they cannot seen with conventional optic micro copy yet life the sea may depend these tiny creatures these examples are just the first glimpse our ignorance life this planet consider the fungi including mush room rusts olds and many disease causing organisms species are known science but more than million have been estimate exist consider the nematode round worm the most abundant all animals four out five animals earth are nematode worm all solid materials except nematode worm were eliminate you could still see the ghost line most nematode worm about species nematode worm have been discovered and diagnose scientists there could hundreds thousands them even millions still unknown this vast main hidden biodiversity increased still further the dark matter the biological world bacteria which within just the last several years still were known from only about species bacteria worldwide but that number bacteria species can found one gram soil just little hand soil the billion bacteria that would there s been estimate that single soil fertile soil contain approximately four million species bacteria all unknown the question what are they all doing the fact don know are living planet with lot activities with reference our living environment done faith and guess alone our lives depend upon these creatures take example close home there are over species bacteria now known friendly bacteria living symbiotic ally your mouth and throat probably necessary your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria this point think have little impression istic film that was made especially for this occasion and like show assist this bill holiday and that may just the beginning the viruses those quasi organisms among which are the ages the gene weave that promote the continued evolution the lives the bacteria are virtually unknown front modern biology world themselves what constitutes viral species still solved although they obviously enormous importance but this much can say the variety genes the planet viruses exceed likely exceed that all the rest life combined nowadays address microbial biodiversity scientists are like explorer boat launched the pacific ocean but that changing rapidly with the aid new genomic technology already possible sequence the entire genetic code bacterium under four hours soon will position forth the field with sequence our back hunt bacteria tiny crevices the habitat s surface the way you watching for birds with binoculars what will find map the living world finally get this under seriously move past the relatively gigantic mammal birds frog and plants the more elusive insects and other small verteb rates and then beyond the count less millions organisms the invisible living world envelope and living within humanity already what were thought bacteria for generation have been found compose instead two great main micro organisms true bacteria and one cell organisms the archaea which are closer than other bacteria the eukaryota the group that long some serious biologist and count myself among them have begun wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity micro organisms one might just might find alien among them true alien stock that arrived from space they had billion years but especially during the earliest period biological evolution this planet know that some bacteria species that have earth origin are capable almost unimaginable extreme temperature and other harsh changes environment including hard radiation strong enough and maintain long enough crack the pyrex vessels around the growing population bacteria there may tempt ation treat the biosphere holistic ally and the species that compose great entities hardly worth distinguish one from the other but each these species even the tiniest prochlorococci are master pieces evolution each has persist for thousands millions years each exqui site adapted the environment which lives inter locked with other species form ecosystem upon which our own lives depend ways have not begun even imagine will destroy these ecosystem and the species them the peril our own existence and unfortunately are destroying them with ingenuity and cease less energy own epiphany conserv ation came while harvard graduate student search for rare ants found the mountain forests cuba ants that shine the sunlight metallic green metallic blue according species and one species discovered metallic gold found magical ants but only after tough climb into the mountain where the last the native cuba forests hung and were then and still are being cut back realized then that these species and large part the other unique marvelous animals and plants that island and this true practical every part the world which took millions years evolve are the process disappearing ever and everywhere one looks the human juggernaut permanent eroding earth s ancient biosphere combination forces that can summarize the acronym hippo the animal hippo for habitat destruction including climate change forced greenhouse gases for the vasive species like the fire ants the zebra mussel room grass and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flood every country and exponential rate that s the the the first one hippo for pollution the second for continued population human population expansion and the final letter for over harvest driving species into extinction excess hunting and fish the hippo juggernaut have created unabated destined according the best estimate going biodiversity research reduce half earth s still surviving animal and plant species extinction critical danger ment the end the century human forced climate change alone again unabated could eliminate quarter surviving species during the next five decade what will and all future generation lose much the living environment thus degrade huge potential source scientific information yet gather much our environmental stability and new kinds pharmaceutical and new products unimaginable strength and value all thrown away the loss will inflict heavy price wealth security and yes spiritual for all time come because previous cataclysms this kind the last one that ended the age dinosaurs took normally five million years repair sad our knowledge biodiversity complete that are risk losing great deal before even discovered for example even the united states the species known currently actually has been found only partial cover mostly unknown basic biology only about percent the known species have been studied well enough evaluate their status the percent evaluate percent are class ified peril that danger extinction that s the united states are short flying blind into our environmental future urgent need change this need have the biosphere properly explore that can understand and competent manage need settle down before wreck the planet and need that knowledge this should big science project equivalent the human genome project should thought biological moon shot with time table this bring wish for tedster and anyone else around the world who hear this talk wish will work together help create the key tools that need inspire preserv ation earth s biodiversity and let call the encyclopedia life what the encyclopedia life concept that has already taken hold and beginning spread and looked seriously encyclopedia that lives the internet and contribute thousands scientists around the world amateur can also has definitely expand able page for each species makes all key information about life earth accessible anyone demand anywhere the world written about this idea before and know there are people this room who have ended significant effort the past but what excite that since first put forward this particular idea that form science has advanced technology has moved forward today the practical ities making such encyclopedia regardless the magnitude the information put into are within reach indeed the past year group influential scientific institution have begun mobil izing realize this dream wish you would help them working together can make this real the encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself practical application will address trans cendent qualities the human consciousness and sense human need will transform the science biology ways obvious benefit humanity and most all can inspire new generation biologist continue the quest that started for personally years ago search for life understand and finally above all preserve that wish thank you
