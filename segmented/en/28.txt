world too many options and too little time our obvious choice just ignore the ordinary stuff marketing guru seth spell out why when comes getting our attention bad bizarre ideas are more successful than boring ones business choice culture marketing shopping storytelling seth standing out going give you four specific examples and going cover the end about how company called silk tripled their sales doing one thing how artist named jeff koons went from being nobody making whole bunch money and having lot impact how frank gehry redefine what meant architect and one biggest failure market the last few years record label started that had called sauce before can that got tell you about sliced bread and guy named rohwedder now before sliced bread was invented the s wonder what they said like the greatest invention since the tele graph something but this guy named rohwedder invented sliced bread and focused like most inventor did the patent part and the making part and the thing about the invention sliced bread this that for the first years after sliced bread was available one bought one knew about was complete and total failure and the reason that until wonder came along and figured out how spread the idea sliced bread one wanted that the success sliced bread like the success almost everything been talking about this conference not always about what the patent like what the factory like s about can you get your idea spread not and think that the way you going get what you want cause the change that you want change happen that you got figure out way get your ideas spread and doesn matter whether you running coffee shop you intellectual you business you flying hot air balloon think that all this stuff applies everybody regardless what that what are living century idea diffusion that people who can spread ideas regardless what those ideas are win and when talk about usually pick business because they make the best pictures that you can put your presentation and because s the easiest sort way keep score but want you give when use these examples because talking about anything that you decide spend your time the heart spread ideas and stuff like and mass media made really easy spread ideas certain way call the industrial complex the way the industrial complex works you buy some ads interrupt some people that gets you distribution you use the distribution you get sell more products you take the profit from that buy more ads and goes around and around and around the same way that military industrial complex worked long time ago and that model and heard yesterday could only get the home page google could only figure out how get promote there could only figure out how grab that person the throat and tell them about what want that then everyone would pay attention and would win well this industrial complex informed entire childhood and probably your mean all these products succeed because someone figured out how touch people way they weren expecting way they didn necessarily want with over and over and over again until they bought and the thing that s happened they the industrial complex that just over the last few years what anybody who market anything has discovered that s not working the way that used this picture really fuzzy apologize had bad cold when took but the product the blue box the center poster child right the sick need buy some medicine the brand manager for that blue product spent million dollars trying interrupt one year million dollars interrupt with commercial and magazine ads and spam and coupons and allow and spiff all could ignore every single message and ignored every message because don have pain ever problem buy the stuff the yellow box because always have and not going invest minute time solve her problem because don care here s magazine called rate s pages about water right articles about water ads about water imagine what the world was like years ago when was just the saturday evening post and time and news week now there are magazine about water new products from coke japan water salad coke japan comes out with new product every three weeks because they have idea what s going work and what s not couldn have written this better myself came out four days ago circle the important parts you can see them here they come out s going spend million dollars promoting oven with the voice arnold hoping that that will get people s and buy roast sandwich now had tried imagine what could possibly animate commercial featur arnold that would get you get your car drive across town and buy roast sandwich now this copernicus and was right when was talking anyone who needs hear your idea the world evolve around favorite person don want get email from anybody want get email consumer and don just mean people who buy stuff the safe mean people the defense department who might buy something people you know the new york who might print your article consumer don care about you all they just don care part the reason they got way more choice than they used and way less time and world where have too many choice and too little time the obvious thing just ignore stuff and able here you driving down the road and you see cow and you keep driving because you seen cows before cows are invisible cows are boring who s going stop and pull over and say look cow nobody but the cow was purple isn that great special effect could that again you want the cow was purple you notice for while mean all cows were purple you get bored with those too the thing that s going decide what gets talked about what gets done what gets changed what gets purchase what gets built remarkable and remarkable really cool word because think just means neat but also means worth making remark about and that the essence where idea diffusion going that two the test cars the united states dollar giant car big enough hold mini trunk people are paying full price for both and the only thing they have common that they don have anything common every week the number one best selling dvd america changes s never the father s never citizen s always some third rate movie with some second rate star but the reason s number one because that s the week came out because s new because s fresh because people saw and said didn know that was there and they noticed two the big success stories the last years tail one sell things that are super expensive blue box and one sell things that are cheap they can make them the only thing they have common that they different now the fashion business matter what for living the fashion business and the thing people the fashion business know what s like the fashion business they used the rest have figure out how think that way how understand that s not about interrupt people with big full page ads insisting meeting with people but s totally different sort process that determines which ideas spread and which ones don this chair they sold billion dollars worth chair inventing what meant sell chair they turned chair from something the chasing department bought something that was status symbol about where you work this guy lionel poilane the most famous baker the world died two and half months ago and was hero mine and dear friend lived paris last year sold million dollars worth french bread every loaf baked bakery owned one baker time wood fire oven and when lionel started his bakery the french pooh pooh ed they didn want buy his bread didn look like french bread wasn what they expect was neat was remarkable and slowly spread from one person another person until finally became the official bread three star restaurant paris now s london and ship all around the world what market used make average products for average people that s what mass marketing smooth out the edge for the center that s the big market they would ignore the geeks and god the laggards was all about going for the center but world where the industrial complex broken don think that s strategy want use any more think the strategy want use not market these people because they really good you but market these people because they care these are the people who are obsessed with something and when you talk them they listen because they like listening s about them and you lucky they tell their friends the rest the curve and spread spread the entire curve they have something call otaku s great japanese word describe the desire someone who s obsessed say drive across tokyo try new noodle place because that s what they they get obsessed with make product market idea come with any problem you want solve that doesn have constituency with otaku almost impossible instead you have find group that really desperate care about what you have say talk them and make easy for them tell their friends there s hot sauce otaku but there s mustard otaku that s why there s lots and lots and lots kinds hot sauce and not many kinds mustard not because s hard make interesting mustard you can make interesting mustard but people don because one s obsessed with and thus one tells their friends krispy kreme has figured this whole thing out krispy kreme has strategy and what they they enter city they talk the people with otaku and then they spread through the city the people who just cross the street this right here cost dollars but sleep for minutes not everybody want but they don care they want talk the people who and maybe spread these guys make the loud car stereo the world s loud jet you can get the car s got bullet glass the windows because they blow out the wind shield otherwise but the fact remain that when someone want put couple speaker their car they got the otaku they heard from someone who does they ahead and they pick this s really simple you sell the people who are listening and maybe just maybe those people tell their friends when steve jobs talk people his note right who are all tuned from countries watching his two hour commercial that s the only thing keeping his company business that those people care desperate enough watch two hour commercial and then tell their friends pearl album released the last two years every one made profit how they only sell them their website those people who buy them the website have the otaku and then they tell their friends and spread and spread this hospital crib cost dollars times the standard but hospital are buying faster than any other model hard candy nail polish doesn appeal everybody but the people who love they talk about like crazy this paint can right here saved
