tipp point author malcolm gladwell gets inside the food industry s suit the perfect spaghetti sauce and makes large argument about the nature choice and happiness business choice culture economic food market media shop story telling malcolm gladwell spaghetti sauce think was supposed talk about new book which called link and s about snap judgments and first impress and comes out janu and hope you all buy trip licate but was thinking about this and realized that although new book makes happy and think would make mother happy s not really about happiness decided instead would talk about some who think has done much make american happy perhaps anyone over the last years man who great personal her mine some the name howard moskowitz who most famous for inventing spaghetti sauce howard s about this high and s round and s his s and has big huge glass and thin grey hair and has kind wonderful exuberance and and has parrot and love the opera and s great aficiona medieval history and fessi s psycho physicist now should tell you that have idea what psychophysics although some point life dated girl for two years who was getting her doctor psychophysics which should tell you something about that relationship far know psychophysics about measuring things and howard very interested measuring things and graduate with his doctor from harvard and set little consult shop white plain new york and one his first clients was this many years ago back the early s one his first clients was pepsi and pepsi came howard and they said you know there s this new thing called aspartame and would like make diet pepsi like you figure out how much aspartame should put each can diet pepsi order have the perfect drink right now that sounds like incredibly straight forward question answer and that s what howard thought because pepsi told him look working with between eight and percent anything eight percent sweetness not sweet enough anything above percent sweetness too sweet want know what s the sweet spot between eight and now gave you this problem you would all say s very simple what you make big experiment batch pepsi every degree sweetness eight percent all the way and try this out with thousands people and the result curve and take the most popular concentration right really simple howard does the experiment and gets the data back and curve and all sudden realize s not nice curve fact the data doesn make any sense s mess s all over the place now most people that business the world test food and such are not dis when the data comes back mess they think well you know figuring out what people think about cola s not that easy you know maybe made error somewhere along the way you know let s just make educat guess and they simply point and they for percent right the middle howard not easily placated howard man certain degree intellectual standard and this was not good enough for him and this question deviled him for years and would think through and say what was wrong why could not make sense this experiment with diet pepsi and one day was sitting diner white plain about trying dream some work for nescafe and suddenly like bolt light the answer came him and that that when they analyze the diet pepsi data they were ask the wrong question they were looking for the perfect pepsi and they should have been looking for the perfect pepsi trust this was enormous elation this was one the most brilliant break through all food science and howard immediate went the road and would conference around the country and would stand and would say you had been looking for the perfect pepsi you wrong you should looking for the perfect pepsi and people would look him with blank look and they would say what are you talking about this crazi and they would say you know move next tried get business nobody would hire him was obsessed though and talked about and talked about and talked about howard love the dish expression worm horseradish the world horseradish this was his horseradish was obsessed with and final had break through vlasic pickle came him and they said moskowitz doctor moskowitz want make the perfect pickle and said there perfect pickle there are only perfect pickle and came back them and said you don just need improve your regular you need create zesty and that s where got zesty pickle then the next person came him and that was campbell s and this was even more important fact campbell s where howard made his ation campbell s made prego and prego the early s was struggling next ragu which was the dominant spaghetti sauce the s and s now the industry don know whether you care about this how much time have into this but was technical speak this side prego better tomato sauce than ragu the quality the tomato paste much better the spice mix far superior adheres the past much more ple way fact they would the famous bowl test back the s with ragu and prego you have late spaghetti and you would right and the ragu would all the bottom and the prego would top that s called adherence and anyway despite the fact that they were far superior adherence and the quality their tomato paste prego was struggling they came howard and they said fix and howard looked their product line and said what you have dead tomato society said this what want and got together with the campbell s kitchen and made varieties spaghetti sauce and varied them according every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce sweetness level garlic ness ness tomato ness visible solids favorite term the spaghetti sauce business every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce varied spaghetti sauce and then took this whole raft spaghetti sauce and went the road went new york went went jacks ville went lo angeles and brought people the truck into big hall and them down for two hours and gave them over the course that two hours ten bowl ten small bowl past with different spaghetti sauce each one and after they ate each bowl they had rate from how good they thought the spaghetti sauce was the end that process after doing for months and months had mountain data about how the american people feel about spaghetti sauce and then analyze the data now did look for the most popular variety spaghetti sauce howard doesn believe that there such thing instead looked the data and said let s see can group all these different data point into clusters let s see they congregate around certain ideas and sure enough you down and you analyze all this data spaghetti sauce you realize that all american fall into one three group there are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy and there are people who like extra chunky and those three fact the third one was the most sign icant because the time the early s you went super market you would not find extra chunky spaghetti sauce and prego turned howard and they said you telling that one third american cra extra chunky spaghetti sauce and yet one servic their needs and said yes and prego then went back and completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce and came out with line extra chunky that immediate and completely took over the spaghetti sauce business this country and over the next years they made million dollars off their line extra chunky sauce and everyone else the industry looked what howard had done and they said god been thinking all wrong and that s when you started get even different kinds vinegar and different kinds mustard and different kinds live oil and then eventually even ragu hire howard and howard did the exact same thing for ragu that did for prego and today you the super market really good one and you look how many ragu there are you know how many they are six varieties cheese light rich amp hearty old world traditional extra chunky garden that s howard s doing that howard s gift the american people now why that important fact enormous important explain you why what howard did fundamentally changed the way the food industry think about making you happy assumpti number one the food industry used that the way find out what people want eat what will make people happy ask them and for years and years and years and years ragu and prego would have focus group and they would all you people down and they would say what you want spaghetti sauce tell what you want spaghetti sauce and for all those years years through all those focus group session one ever said they wanted extra chunky even though least third them deep their heart actually did people don know what they want right howard love say the mind know not what the ngue want s mystery and critical important step understand our own desire and taste realize that can always explain what want deep down asked all you for example this room what you want coffee you know what you say every one you would say want dark rich hearty roast s what people always say when you ask them what they want coffee what you like dark rich hearty roast what percent you actually like dark rich hearty roast according howard somewhere between and percent you most you like milky weak coffee but you will never ever say some who ask you what you want that want milky weak coffee that s number one thing that howard did number two thing that howard did made realize s another very critical point made realize the importance what like call horizontal segment ation why this critical s critical because this the way the food industry thought before howard right what were they obsessed with the early s they were obsessed with mustard particular they were obsessed with the story grey poupon right used there were two mustard french s and gulden s what were they yellow mustard what s yellow mustard yellow mustard seeds turmeric and paprika that was mustard grey poupon came along with dij right much more volatile mustard see some white wine nose much more licate aromatics and what they they put little tiny glass with wonderful enameled label made look french even though s made oxnard california and instead charg dollar fifty for the eight ounce bottle the way that french s and gulden s did they decided charg four dollars and then they had those ads right with the guy the roll royce and s eat the grey poupon the other roll royce pull and says you have any grey poupon and the whole thing after they did that grey poupon take off take over the mustard business and everyone s take home less from that was that the way get make people happy give them something that more expensive something spire right s make them turn their back what they think they like now and reach out for something high the mustard hierarchy better mustard more expensive mustard mustard more phistic ation and culture and meaning and howard looked that and said that s wrong mustard does not exist hierarchy mustard exist just like tomato sauce horizontal plane there good mustard bad mustard there perfect mustard perfect mustard there are only different kinds mustard that suit different kinds people fundamentally democratized the way think about taste and for that well howard moskowitz huge vote thank third thing that howard did and perhaps the most important howard conf ronted the notion the platonic dish what mean that for the long time the food industry there was sense that there was one way perfect way make dish you chez panisse they give you the red tail sashimi with roast pump seeds something something reduction they don give you five options the reduction right they don say you want the extra chunky reduction you want the you just get the reduction why because the che chez panisse has platonic notion about red tail sashimi this the way ought and she serves that way time and time again and you quarrel with her she will say you know what you wrong this the best way ought this restaurant now that same idea fuel the mercial food industry well they had notion platonic notion what tomato sauce was and where did that come from came from italian tomato sauce what s ended s thin the culture tomato sauce was thin when talked about authentic tomato sauce the s talked about italian tomato sauce talked about the earliest ragu which had visible solids right which were thin and you just put little bit over and sun down the bottom the past that s what was and why were attached that because thought that what took make people happy was provide them with the most cultural authentic tomato sauce and thought that gave them the cultural authentic tomato sauce then they would embrace and that s what would please the maximum number people and the reason thought that other words people the cooking world were looking for cooking universal they were looking for one way treat all and s good reason for them obsessed with the idea universal because all science through the century and much the was obsessed with universal psycho logist medical scientist economists were all interested finding out the rule that govern the way all have but that changed right what the great revolution science the last years the move from the search for universal the understand variability now medical science don want know how necessarily just how cancer work want know how your cancer different from cancer guess cancer different from your cancer genetic has opened the door the study human variability what howard moskowitz was doing was saying this same revolution needs happen the world tomato sauce and for that him great vote thank give you one last illustration variability and that sorry howard not only believe that but took second step which was say that when pursue universal principle food aren just making error are actually doing ourselves mass service and the example used was coffee and coffee something did lot work with with nescafe were ask all you try and come with coffee type coffee brew that made all you happy and then asked you rate that coffee the average score this room for coffee would about scale ever you allowed break you into coffee clusters maybe three four coffee clusters and could make coffee just for each those individual clusters your score would from the difference between coffee and coffee difference between coffee that makes you win and coffee that makes you delirious happy that the final and think most beautiful less howard moskowitz that embrac the diversity human being will find sur way true happiness thank you
