legendary scientist david deutsch put theoretical physics the back burn discuss more urgent matter the survival our species the first step toward solving global warming says admit that have problem climate change cosmos culture environment global issues physics science technology universe david deutsch our place the cosmos been told out limb and say something surprising try and that but want start with two things that everyone already know and the first one fact something that has been known for most recorded history and that that the planet earth the solar system our environment whatever unique suit sustain our evolution creation used thought and our present existence and most important our future survival nowadays this idea has dramatic name spaceship earth and the idea there that outside the spaceship the universe implac ably hostile and inside all have all depend and only get the one chance mess our spaceship got where else now the second thing that everyone already know that contrary what was believed for most human history human beings are not fact the hub existence stephen hawking famous said just chemical scum the surface typical planet that s orbit around typical star which the skirts typical galaxy and now the first those two things that everyone know kind saying that very typical place unique suit and and the second one saying that typical place and especially you regard these two deep truth live and form your life decisions then they seem little bit conflict with each other but that doesn prevent them from both being completely false and they are let start with the second one typical well this typical place well let s look around you know and look random direction and see wall and chemical scum and that s not typical the universe all all you got few hundred miles that same direction and look back and you won see any wall chemical scum all all you see blue planet and you further than that you see the sun the solar system and the stars and but that s still not typical the universe because stars come galaxies and most places the universe typical place the universe where near any galaxies let s out further till outside the galaxy and look back and yeah there s the huge galaxy with spiral arm laid out front and this point come light years from here but still where near typical place the universe get typical place you got times far that into intergalactic space and what does that look like typical what does typical place the universe look like well enormous expense ted has arranged high solution immersion virtual reality render intergalactic space the view from intergalactic space can have the light off please can see well not quite not quite perfect you see intergalactic space intergalactic space completely dark pitch dark s dark that you were looking the near star you and that star were explod supernova and you were star directly the moment when light reached you you still wouldn able see even glimmer that s how big and how dark the universe and that s despite the fact that supernova bright brilliant even that would kill you stone dead range several light years and yet from intergalactic space s far away you wouldn even see s also very cold out there less than three degrees above absolute zero and s very empty the vacuum there one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology earth can currently create that s how different typical place from this place and that how typical this place can have the light back please thank you now how know about environment that s far away and different and alien from anything used well the earth our environment the form creating knowledge well what does that mean well look out even further than just been mean from here with telescope and you see things that look like stars they called quasar quasar originally meant quasi stellar object which means things that look bit like stars but they not stars and know what they are billion years ago and billion light years away the material the center galaxy collapse towards super massive black hole and then intense magnetic fields direct some the energy that gravitational collapse and some the matter back out the form tremendous jet which illumina lobe with the brilliance think s trillion sun now the physics the human brain could hardly more unlike the physics such jet couldn survive for instant language break down when trying describe what would like one those jet would bit like experiencing supernova explosion but point blank range and for millions years time and yet that jet happened precisely such way that billion years later the other side the universe some bit chemical scum could accurate describe and model and predict and explain above all there s your reference what was happening there reality the one physical system the brain contain accurate working model the other the quasar not just superficial image though contain that well but explanatory model body the same mathematical relationship and the same causal structure now that knowledge and that weren amazing enough the faith fulness with which the one structure resemb the other increasing with time that the growth knowledge the laws physics have this special property that physical objects unlike each other they could possibly can nevertheless body the same mathematical and causal structure and more and more over time are chemical scum that different this chemical scum has universal structure contain with ever increasing precision the structure everything this place and not other places the universe hub which contain within itself the structural and causal essence the whole the rest physical reality and far from being significant the fact that the laws physics allow this even mandate that this can happen one the most important things about the physical world now how does the solar system and our environment the form acquire this special relationship with the rest the universe well one thing that s true about stephen hawking s remark mean true but s the wrong emphasis one thing that s true about that doesn with any special physics there s special dispens ation miracle involved does simply with three things that have here abundance one them matter because the growth knowledge form information process information process computation computation require computer there s known way making computer without matter also need energy make the computer and most important make the media effect which record the knowledge that discover and then third less tangible but just essential for the open ended creation knowledge explanation evidence now our environment dated with evidence happen get round testing let s say s law gravity about years ago but the evidence that used that was falling down every square meter the earth for billion years before that and will continue fall for billion years afterwards and the same true for all the other science far know evidence discover the most fundamental truth all the science here just for the taking our planet our location rated with evidence and also with matter and energy out intergalactic space those three prerequisites for the open ended creation knowledge are their lowest possible supply said s empty s cold and s dark out there now actually that s just another parochial conception because imagine cube out there intergalactic space the same size our home the solar system now that cube very empty human standards but that still means that contain over million tons matter and million tons enough make say self contain space station which there s colon scientists that are devoted creating open ended stream knowledge and now s way beyond present technology even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space and form into other element and but the thing comp rehensible universe something isn forbidden the laws physics then what could possibly prevent from doing other than know how other words s matter knowledge not resource and the same well could that automatically have energy supply because the trans mutation would fusion actor and evidence well again s dark out there human sense but all you got take telescope even one present day design look out and you see the same galaxies from here and with more powerful telescope you able see stars and planets those galaxies you able astrophysics and learn the laws physics and local there you could build particle accele ators and learn element particle physics and chemistry and probably the hardest science would biology field trips because would take several hundred million years get the near life bear planet and back but have tell you and sorry richard but never did like biology field trips much and think can just about make with one every few hundred million years fact intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open ended creation knowledge any such cube anywhere the universe could become the same kind hub that are the knowledge how were present there not unique hospi table place intergalactic space capable creating open ended stream explanation then almost every other environment the earth pollute earth and the limit factor there and here not resource because they plentiful but knowledge which scarce now this cosmic knowledge based view may and think ought make feel very special but should also make feel vulnerable because means that without the specific knowledge that s needed survive the going challenge the universe won survive them all takes for supernova off few light years away and all dead martin has recently written book about our vulner ability all sorts things from astrophysics scientific experiment gone wrong and most important terror with weapon mass destruction and think that civilization has only percent chance surviving this century think s going talk about that later the conference now don think that probability the right category discuss this issue but agree with him about this can survive and can fail survive but depend not chance but whether create the relevant knowledge time the danger not all unprecedented species extinct all the time civilization end the overwhelm majority all species and all civilization that have ever existed are now history and want the exception that then logical our only hope make use the one feature that distinguish our species and our civilization from all the others namely our special relationship with the laws physics our ability create new explanation new knowledge hub existence let now apply this current controversy not because want advocate any particular solution but just illustrate the kind thing mean and the controversy global warming now physicist but not the right kind physicist regard global warming just and the rational thing for take seriously the prevail scientific theory and according that theory s already too late avoid disaster because s true that our best the moment prevent emissions with something like the kyoto protocol with constraints economic activity and enormous cost hundreds billion dollars whatever then that already disaster any reasonable measure and the action that are advocate are not even purpor solve the problem merely postpone little s already too late avoid and probably has been too late avoid ever since before anyone realized the danger was probably already too late the s when the best available scientific theory was telling that industrial emissions were about precipitate new ice age which billion would die now the lesson that seems clear and don know why isn form public debate that can always know when know impending disaster and how solve cost less than the cost the disaster itself then there s not going much argument really but precaut ions and precaut principle can avoid problems that not yet fore need problem fix not just problem avoidance and s true that ounce prevention equal pound cure but that s only know what prevent you been ched the nose then the science medicine does not consist teaching you how avoid medical science stopped seek cures and concentrate prevention only then would achieve very little either the world buzz the moment with plans force reduction gas emissions all cost ought buzz with plans reduce the temperature and with plans live the higher temperature and not all cost but efficient and cheaply and some such plans exist things like swarms mirror space deflect the sunlight away and encouraging aquatic organisms eat more carbon dioxide the moment these things are fringe research they not central the human effort face this problem problems general and with problems that are not aware yet the ability put right not the good luck avoid definitely our only hope not just solving problems but survival take two stone table and them one them problems are luble and the other one problems are inevitable thank you
