accepting his ted prize inventor robert fischell makes three wishes designing portable device that treat migraine finding new cures for clinical depression and form the medical malpractice system ted prize business disease health care invention medicine science technology robert fischell medical inventing going discuss with you three invention that can have effect million people which will hope see happen discuss the prior film some the old things that did like stent and insulin pump for the diabetic and like talk very briefly about three new invention that will change the lives many people the present time takes average three hours after the first symptoms heart attack are recognize the patient before that patient arrive emergency room and people with silent chemia which translate into english means they don have any symptoms takes even longer for them get the hospital the ami cute myocardial infarction which doctor s big word they can charge you more money means heart attack annual incidence million americans mortality people dying each year about half them have permanent damage their heart that will cause them have very bad problems later thus people either have died have significant damage their heart muscle symptoms are often denied the patient particularly men because are very brave are very brave and don want admit that having hell chest pain then approximately percent all patients never have any symptoms what are going about them how can save their lives s particularly true diabetic and elder women well what needed for the earliest possible warning heart attack means determine there s complete block coronary artery that ladies and gentlemen heart attack the means consist not something little technical segment elevation the electrogram translate into english that means that there s electrical signal the heart and one part the ecg which call the segment elevate that sure sign heart attack and had computer put into the body person who s risk could know before they even have symptoms that they having heart attack save their life well the doctor can program level this elevation volt that will trigger emergency alarm vibr ation like your cell phone but right your clavicle bone and when goes beep beep beep you better something about because you want live you have get some medical treatment have try these device out because the fda won just let use them people unless try out first and the best model for this happens pig and what tried with the pig was external electro the skin like you see emergency room and going show you why they don work very well and then put lead which wire the right ventric inside the heart which does the electrogram which the signal volt from inside the heart well with the pig the baseline before block the pig s artery simulate heart attack that was the signal after seconds even expert couldn tell the difference and after three minutes well you really studied you see difference but what happened when looked inside the pig s heart the electrogram there was the baseline first all much bigger and more reliable signal second all even you people who are trained can see the difference and see here segment elevation right after this sharp line look the difference there doesn take much every person could see that difference and computers can programmed easily detect then look that after three minutes see that the signal that s actually the heart can use tell people that they having heart attack even before they have symptoms can save their life then tried with tim fischell tried some human patients who had have stent put well kept the balloon filled block the artery simulate block which what heart attack and s not hard see that the baseline the first picture the upper left next seconds you see this rise here then this rise that s the elevation and had computer that could detect could tell you you having heart attack early could save your life and prevent congesti heart failure and then did again filled the balloon again few minutes later and here you see even after seconds great rise this piece which can have computers inside under your chest like pacemaker with wire into your heart like pacemaker and computers don sleep have little battery and this little battery that computer will run for five years without need replacement what does the system look like well the left the which plant able medical device and night the tent you can see they exhibit s about this big the size pacemaker s implanted with very conventional technique and the external device that you can have your night table wake you and tell you get your tail the emergency room when the thing goes off because you don you deep doo doo and then finally program that will set the level the stimulation which the level which says you are having heart attack the fda says test this final device after s built some animal which said pig had get this pig have heart attack and when you the farm yard you can easily get pig have heart attack said well experts stent night you see some our invented stent said put stent but not going put stent that put people putting copper stent and this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attack that s not very nice but after all had find out what the answer took two copper stent and put the artery this pig and let show you the result that s very far people who have heart disease are concerned there was thursday morning stopped the pig s medication and there his electrogram the signal from inside the pig s heart coming out radio tele then friday began get certain sign which later had the pig run around not going into this early stage but look what happened after moved this pig s medication that kept him from having heart attack any one you now expert elevation can you see there can you see the picture after the big rise the qrs you see elevation this pig was having heart attack what happens after you have the heart attack this block your rhythm becomes regular and that s what happened minutes later then ventric ular fibrill ation the heart quivers instead beat this just before death the pig and then the pig died went flat line but had little bit over hour where could saved this pig s life well because the fda didn save the pig s life because need this type animal research for humans but when comes the sake human can save their life can save the lives people who are high risk for heart attack what the response cute myocardial infarction heart attack today well you feel some chest pain digest s not all that bad you decide not anything several hours pass and gets worse and even the man won ignore finally you the emergency room you wait burn and other critical patients are treated because percent the patients who emergency room with chest pain don have ami you not taken very seriously they finally see you takes more time get your electro gram your skin and diagnose and s hard because they don have the baseline data which the computer put you gets finally you lucky you are treated three four hours after the incident but the heart muscle has died and that the typical treatment the advanced world not africa that s the typical treatment the advanced world today developed the angelmed guardian system and have device inside this patient called the implanted angelmed guardian and when you have block the alarm goes off and send the alarm and the electrogram external device which gets your baseline electrogram from hours ago and the one that caused the alarm you can take the emergency room and show them and say take care right away then goes network operation center where they get your data from your patient database that s been put some central location say the united states then goes diagnostic center and within one minute your heart attack your signal appear the screen computer and the computer analyze what your problem and the person who s there the medical practitioner call you this also cell phone and says smith you deep doo doo you have problem called the ambulance the ambulance the way pick you and then going call your doctor tell him about going send him the signal that have that says you have heart attack and going send the signal the hospital and going have analyzed there and there you going with your doctor and you taken care you won die heart attack that s the first invention that wanted describe and now want talk about something entirely different first didn think migraine headaches were big problem because never had migraine headache but then spoke some people who have three four every week their life and their lives are being totally ruin have mission statement for our company doing migraine which prevent amelio rate migraine headaches the application safe controlled magnetic pulse applied needed the patient now you probably very few physicist here you physicist you know there s certain s law which says apply magnetic pulse salt water that s your brains the way generate electric current and the electric current the brain can erase migraine headache that s what have discovered here s picture what doing the patients who have migraine precede aura have band excited neurons that s shown red that move three five millimeter minute towards the mid brain and when hits the mid brain that s when the headache begins there s this migraine that precede visual aura and this visual aura the way and show you picture but sort begins with little dancing light gets bigger and bigger until fill your whole visual field and what tried was this here device called the well model weighs about pounds has wire about inch meter and here s one the patients who has aura and always has headache bad one after the aura what this what aura looks like s sort funny dancing light shown there the left and right side and that s fully developed visual aura see top the middle our experimental the neurologist who said going move this down little and going erase half your aura and god the neurologist did erase and that s the middle picture half the aura erased short magnetic pulse what does that mean that means that the magnetic pulse generating electric current that s interfering with the erroneous electrical activity the brain and finally says now going all the aura get erased with appropriate placed magnetic pulse what the result designed magnetic depolarizer that looks like this that you could have lady her pocket book and when you get aura you can try and see how works well the next thing they have show what was abc news channel last week new york city the clock news anchor for anyone who suffer from migraine headaches and there are million americans who night possible answer witness news report stacy sager night with small and portable machine that literally zaps your migraine away christina side bottom well first reaction was that was looked awful gun like and was very strange stacy sager but for christina side bottom almost anything was worth trying could stop migraine may look even frightening you walk around with your purse but research here ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper say scientific ally sound that fact when the average person gets migraine s caused something similar electrical pulse the zapper create magnetic field counter that you mohammed other words treating electricity with electricity rather than treating electricity with the chemical that using nowadays s but safe use everyday experts say the research has actually been around for more than decade and more long term studies need done christina now wear s been the most wonderful thing for migraine s research are hoping present their studies the fda this summer robert fischell and that the invention treat migraine you see the problem million americans have migraine headaches and need means treat and think that now have and this the first device that did and going talk about second wish which has something with this our conclusion from our studies far three research center there mark improvement pain level after using just once the most severe headaches responded better after did several times and the unexpected finding indicate that even establish headaches not only those with aura get treated and get diminish and aura can erased and the migraine then does not occur and that the migraine invention that are talking about and that are working the third and last invention began with idea epilepsy can best treated responsive electrical stimulation now why use add nearly epileptic focus now unfortunately technical people unlike bono have get into all these technical words well responsive electrical stimulation means that sense place your brain which called epileptic focus which where the epileptic seizure begins sense there that s going happen and then respond apply electrical energy that spot which erase the signal that you don get the clinical manifest ations the migraine headache use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that s used for the heart thought could adapt for the brain the device could implanted under the scalp totally hidden and avoid wire break which occur you put the chest and you try move your neck around form company develop neuro pacemaker for epilepsy well other diseases the brain because all diseases the brain are result some electrical function that causes many not all brain disorder formed company called neuropace and started work responsive neuro stimulation and this picture what the device looked like that s placed into the cranial bone this probably better picture here have our device which put frame there s cut made the scalp s opened the neuro has plate mark around and uses dental burr move piece the cranial bone exactly the size our device and night you able see the device the tent and then with four screw put frame then snap the device and run with wire the one shown green will the surface the brain with electro the epileptic focus the origin the epilepsy where can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells when hit with some electrical current prevent the clinical manifest ation the seizure the blue wire see what s called deep brain electro that s the source the epilepsy can attack that well the comprehensive solution this the device s about one inches two inches and odd enough just the thick ness most cranial bone the advantage responsive neuro stimulation can detect and terminate seizure before the clinical symptoms occur provide stimulation only when needed can turned off seizure disappear has minimal side effects matter fact all our clinical trials date seen side effects the patients whom s been implanted and s invisible cosmetic ally hidden you have epilepsy and you have the device one will know because you can tell that s there and this shows what electroencephalogram and the left the signal spontaneous seizure one the patients then stimul ated and you see how that heavy black line and then you see the electroencephalogram signal going normal which means they did not get the epileptic seizure that conclude discussion epilepsy which the third invention that want discuss here this afternoon have three wishes well can much about africa tech into medical gadget which mostly high tech stuff like bono talked about the first wish use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator called for responsive neurostimulator that s brilliant acronym for the treatment other brain disorder well going for epilepsy why the hell not try for something else then you saw what that device looked like that the woman was using fix her migraine tell you this that s something which some research engineer like would concoct not real designer good equipment want have some people who really know how this perform human engineering studies develop the optimum design for the portable device for treating migraine headaches and some the sponsor this ted meeting are such organization then going challenge the ted attendees come with way improve health care the where have problems that africa doesn have and reducing malpractice litigation malpractice litigation not african problem s american problem get quickly first wish the brain operate electrical signals the electrical signals create brain disorder electro stimulation can over come that disorder acting the brain s neurons other words you screwed electrical signals maybe putting other electrical signals from computer the brain can counter that signal the brain that trigger brain function might sense trigger for electro stimulation like doing with epilepsy but even there signal electro stimulation appropriate part the brain can turn off brain disorder and want this involved with the ted group such obsessive compulsive disorder that present not well treated with drugs and include five million americans and fisc and his group neuropace and myself believe that can have dramatic effect improving ocd america and the world that the first wish the second wish the present time the clinical trials trans cranial magnetic stimul ators that s what tms means device treat migraine headaches appear quite successful well that s the good news the present portable device far from optimal designed both human factor appearance think she said looks like gun lot people don like guns engage company having prior success for human factor engineering and industrial design optimize the design the first portable tms device that will sold the patients who have migraine headaches and that the second wish and the dollar prize money that ted was give ating dollars the neuropace people get with the treatment ocd obsessive compulsive disorder and making another available for company optimize the design the device for migraine and that s how use dollar prize money well the third and final wish some what unfortunately s much more complicated because involve lawyer well medical malpractice litigation the has escalat the cost malpractice insurance that competent physicians are leaving their practice lawyer take case contingency with the hope big share big settlement sympathetic jury because this patient really ended bad the high cost health care the part due litigation and insurance cost seen pictures graph today s today showing rocket out control and this one factor well how can the ted community help with this situation have couple ideas begin with starting point for discussion with the ted group major part the problem the nature the written extent informed consent that the patient spouse must read and sign for example asked the epilepsy people what are they using for informed consent would you believe pages single space the patient has read before they our trial cure their epilepsy what you think someone has the end reading single space pages they don understand what the hell s about that s the present system how about making video have entertainment people here have people who know how video with visual presentation the anatomy and procedure done with animation everybody know that can better with visual thing that can interactive with the patient where they see the video and they being video and they press you understand this don well then let s simpler explanation then there s simpler one and yes understand that well press the button and you record you understand and that one the ideas now also video done the patient spouse and medical present with the patient agree that understand the procedure done including all the possible failure modes the patient spouse agree not file suit one the known procedure failure occur now america fact you cannot give your right trial jury however video there that everything was explained you and you have all the video file much less likely that some shot lawyer will take this case contingency because won nearly good case medical error occur the patient spouse agree settlement for fair compensation arbitr ation instead going court that would save hundreds millions dollars legal cost the united states and would decrease the cost medicine for everyone these are just some starting point and there that s the end all wishes wish had more wishes but three what got and there they are
