jeff han shows off cheap scalable multi touch and pressure sensitive computer screen interface that may spell the end point and click demo design interface design technology jeff han demo his break through touch screen really really excited here today because about show you some stuff that s just ready come out the lab literally and really glad that you guys are going among the first able see person because really really think this going change really change the way interact with machines from this point now this rear project raft table s about inches wide and s equipped with multi touch sensor now normal touch sensor that you see like kiosk interactive white boards can only register one point contact time this thing allows you have multiple point the same time they can use both hands can use chord action can just right and use all finger wanted you know like that now multi touch sensing isn completely new mean people like bill buxt have been playing around with the s however the approach built here actually high solution low cost and probably most important very scalable the technology you know isn the most exciting thing here right now other than probably found access what s really interesting here what you can with and the kind interface you can build top let s see for instance have lava lamp application here now you can see can use both hands kind squeez together and put the blobs together can ject heat into the system here can pull apart with two finger s completely intuitive there s instruction manual the interface just kind disappear this started out kind screen app that one the students our lab rose berg made but think true identity comes out here now what s great about multi touch sensor that you know could doing this with many finger here but course multi touch also inherent means multi user chris could out here interacting with another part lava while kind play around with here you can imagine new kind sculp tool where kind warming something making able and then letting cool down and solidifying certain state google should have something like this their show you something little more concrete example here this thing loads this photographer s light box application again can use both hands interact and move photos around but what s even cool that have two finger can actually grab photo and then stretch out like that really easily can pan and rotate effort less can that gross with both hands can just with two finger each hands together grab the can kind the same thing stretch out can simultaneously where holding this down and grip ping another one stretch this out like this again the interface just disappear here there s manual this exactly what you expect especially you haven interact with computer before now when you have initiative like the laptop kind cringe the idea that going introduce whole new generation people computing with this standard mouse and windows point interface this something that think really the way should interacting with machines from this point now course can bring keyboard and can bring that around put that there now obviously this kind standard keyboard but course can scale make work well for hands and that s really important because there s reason this day and age that should form physical device that leads bad things like have much technology nowadays that these interface should start form there s little applied now actually improving the way interact with interface from this point this keyboard probably actually the really wrong direction you can imagine the future develop this kind technology keyboard that kind automatically drift your hand move away and really intelligent anticipate which key you trying stroke with your hands again isn this great audience where s your lab jeff han research scientist new york here s example another kind app can make these little fuzz ball remember the stroke making course can with all hands s pressure sensitive you can notice but what s neat about that again showed you that two finger gesture that allows you really quickly because you don have switch hand tool the magn glass tool you can just continuous make things real multiple scale all the same time can create big things out here but can back and really quickly back where started and make even smaller things here now this going really important start getting things like data visual ization for instance think all really enjoy hans rosling s talk and really emphasize the fact that been thinking about for long time too have all this great data but for some reason s just sitting there not really access and one the reasons why think that because helped things like graphic and visual ization and ference tools but also think big part going starting able have better interface able drill down into this kind data while still thinking about the big picture here let show you another app here this something called world wind s done nasa s kind all seen google earth this open source version that there are plug in able load different data set that nasa s collect over the years but you can see can use the same two finger gesture down and really seamless there s interface again really allows anybody kind and just does what you expect you know again there s just interface here the interface just disappear can switch different data view that s what s neat about this app here there you nasa s really cool they have these hyper spec tral images that are false color you can s really good for deter mining ative use well let s back this now the great thing about mapping application s not really s kind again with multi point interface you can gesture like this you can able tilt around like that you know s not just simply ated kind ning and motion now this gesture that developed again just putting two finger down s defining axis tilt and can tilt and down that way that s something just came with the spot you know s probably not the right thing but there s such interesting things you can with this kind interface s just much fun playing around with too and the last thing want show you you know sure can all think lot entertainment app that you can with this thing little more interested the kind creative application can with this now here s simple application here can draw out curve and when close becomes character but the neat thing about can add control point and then what can manipulate them with both finger the same time and you notice what does s kind puppeteer thing where can use many finger have draw and make now there s lot actual math going under here for this control this mesh and the right thing mean this technique being able manipulate mesh here with multiple control point actually something that s state the art was just released graph last year but s great example the kind research really love all this comp power apply make things the right things intuitive things exactly what you expect multi touch interaction research very active field right now hci not the only one doing there are lot other people getting into this kind technology going let even more people get into and really looking forward interacting with all you guys over the next few days and seeing how can apply your respect fields thank you
