speaking both astronomer and concerned member the human race sir martin examines our planet and future from cosmic perspective urge action prevent dark consequence from our scientific and technological development astronomy climate change complexity cosmos future leadership science social change technology universe martin asks this our final century you take people random have something common their interest business lie near the earth s surface the odd one out astronomer and one that strange breed talk will two parts talk first astronomer and then worried member the human race but let s start off remember that darwin showed how the come four billion years evolution and what try astronomy and cosm ology back before darwin s simple beginning set our earth cosmic context and let just run through few slides this was the impact that happened last week come they sent nuke would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last monday that s another project for nasa that s mars from the european mars express and new year this artist s impression turned into reality when parachute landed titan saturn s giant moon landed the surface this pictures taken the way down that looks like coast line indeed but the ocean liquid methane the temperature minus degrees cent grade beyond our solar system learned that the stars aren point light each one like sun with retinue planets orbit around and can see places where stars are form like the eagle nebula see stars dying six billion years the sun will look like that and some stars die spectacular supernova explosion leaving remnant like that still bigger scale see entire galaxies stars see entire ecosystem where gas being recycled and the cosmologist these galaxies are just the atoms were the large scale universe this picture shows patch sky small that would take about patch like cover the full moon the sky through small telescope this would look quite blank but you see here hundreds little faint smudges each galaxy fully like our which looks small and faint because light has taken billion light years get the stars those galaxies probably don have planets around them there s chance life there that s because there s been time for the nuclear fusion stars make silicon and carbon and iron the building block planets and life believe that all this emerged from big bang hot dense state how did that amorphous big bang turn into our complex cosmos going show you movie simulation power faster than real time which shows patch the universe where the expansion have tract out but you see time goes giga years the bottom you will see structure evolve gravity feed small dense regular ities and structure develop and end after billion years with something looking rather like our own universe and compare simulate universe like that show you better simulation the end talk with what actually see the sky well can trace things back the earlier stages the big bang but still don know what bang and why bang that s challenge for century science research group had logo would this picture here oboros where you see the micro world the left the world the quantum and the right the large scale universe planets stars and galaxies know our universe are united though links between left and right the everyday world determine atoms how they stick together make molecules stars are fuel how the nuclei those atoms together and learned the last few years galaxies are held together the gravitational pull called dark matter particle huge swarms far smaller even than atomic nuclei but like know the synthesis symbol ized the very top the micro world the quantum understood the right hand side gravity hold einstein explained that but the finished business for century science link together cosmos and micro world with ified theory symbol ized were gastronomic ally the top that picture and until have that synthesis won able understand the very beginning our universe because when our universe was itself the size atom quantum effects could shake everything and need theory that ifies the very large and the very small which don yet have one idea incident ally and had this hazard sign say going speculate from now that our big bang was not the only one one idea that our three dimensional universe may embedded high dimensional space just you can imagine these sheet paper you can imagine ants one them thinking s two dimensional universe not being aware another population ants the other there could another universe just millimeter away from our but not aware because that millimeter measured some fourth spatial dimension and imprisoned our three and believe that there may lot more physical reality than what normally called our universe the after math our big bang and here s another picture bottom right our universe which the horiz not beyond that but even that just one bubble were some vast reality many people suspect that just gone from believing one solar system ions solar systems one galaxy many galaxies have many big bang from one big bang perhaps these many big bang display immense variety properties well let s back this picture there s one challenge symbol ized the top but there s another challenge science symbol ized the bottom you want not only synthesize the very large and the very small but want understand the very complex and the most complex things are ourselves between atoms and stars depend stars make the atoms made depend chemistry determine our complex structure clearly have large compared atoms have layer upon layer complex structure clearly have small compared stars and planets otherwise rush gravity and fact are would take many human bodies make the sun there are atoms each the metric mean the mass proton and the mass the sun kilogram within factor two the mass each person here well most you anyway the science complexity probably the greatest challenge all greater than that the very small the left and the very large the right and s this science which not only enlighten our understanding the biological world but also transform our world faster than ever and more than that s gender new kinds change and now move the second part talk and the book our final century was mentioned was not self facing would mention the book myself and would add that s available paper back and america was called our final hour because americans like instant gratification but that this century not only has science changed the world faster than ever but new and different ways target drugs genetic modification artificial intelligence perhaps even plants into our brains may change human beings themselves and human beings their physique and character has not changed for thousands years may change this century s new our history and the human impact the global environment greenhouse warming mass extinction and forth unprecedented too and this makes this coming century challenge bio and cyber technologies are environmentally benign that they offer marvelous prospect while nonetheless reducing pressure energy and resource but they will have dark side our interconnect world novel technology could empower just one fanatic some weird with mind those who now design computer viruses trigger some kind disaster indeed catastrophe could arise simply from technical adventure error rather than terror and even tiny probability catastrophe unacceptable when the down side could global consequence fact some years ago bill joy wrote article express tremendous concern about robots taking over etc don along with all that but s interesting that had simple solution was what called fine grain relinquish ment wanted give the dangerous kind science and keep the good bit now that s absurd naive for two reasons first any scientific discovery has benign consequence well dangerous ones and also when scientist makes discovery she normally has clue what the application are going and what this means that have accept the risk are going enjoy the benefits science have accept that there will hazard and think have back what happened the post war era post world war when the nuclear scientists who been involved making the atomic bomb many case were concerned that they should all they could alert the world the danger and they were inspired not the young einstein who did the great work relativ but the old einstein the icon poster and shirt who failed his scientific effort the physical laws was premature but was moral pass inspiration scientists who were concerned with arm control and perhaps the greatest living person someone privilege know joe rothblatt equally untidy office there you can see s years old and founded the pugwash movement persuade einstein his last act sign the famous memor bert sell and set example the concerned scientist and think harness science optimal choose which door open and which leave closed need latter day counter parts people like joseph rothblatt need not just campaign physicist but need biologist computer experts and environment lists well and think academic and independent entrepreneur have special obligation because they have more freedom than those government service company employee subject commercial pressure wrote book our final century scientist just general scientist but there s one respect think which being cosmologist offered special perspective and that s that offer awareness the immense future the stupendous time span the evolutionary past are now part common culture outside the american bible belt anyway but most people even those who are familiar with evolution aren mind that even more time lies ahead the sun has been shining for four and half billion years but another six billion years before fuel runs out that schematic picture sort time picture half and another six billion before that happens and any remain life earth vapor ized there s thinking tendency imagine that humans will there experiencing the sun s demise but any life and intelligence that exists then will different from are from bacteria the fold intelligence and complexity still has immense far here earth and probably far beyond are still the beginning the emergence complexity our earth and beyond you represent the earth s life time single year say from january when was made december the century would quarter second june tiny fraction the year but even this concert cosmic perspective our century very very special the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet should have shown this earlier will not humans who witness the end point the sun will creatures different from are from bacteria when einstein died one striking tribute his global status was this cartoon block the washington post the plaque read albert einstein lived here and like end with vignette were inspired this image been familiar for years with this image the fragile beauty land ocean and cloud contrast with the ster moon cape which the astronauts left their footprint but let s suppose some alien had been watching our pale blue the cosmos from not just for years but for the entire billion year history our earth what would they have seen over nearly all that immense time earth s appearance would have changed very gradual the only abrupt worldwide change would have been major asteroid impact volcanic super erupt ions apart from those brief trauma nothing happens suddenly the continent landmass drift around ice cover waxed and waned success ions new species emerged evolved and became extinct but just tiny liver the earth s history the last one million part few thousand years the patterns vegetation alter much faster than before this signal the start agriculture change has accele rated human population rose then other things happened even more abrupt within just years that s one hundred one million the earth s age the amount carbon dioxide the atmosphere started rise and ominous fast the planet became intense emitter radio wave the total from all and cell phones and radar transmission and something else happened metallic objects very small ones few tons most escape into orbit around the earth some journey the moon and planets race advanced extra terrestrial watching our solar system from could confide predict earth s final another six billion years but could they have predict this unprecedented spike less than half through the earth s life these human induced alter ations occupy over less than million the elapsed life time and seemingly occur ring with away speed they continued their vigil what might these hypothetical alien witness the next hundred years will some spasm fore close earth s future will the biosphere stabilize will some the metallic objects launched from the earth spawn new oases post human life else where the science done the young einstein will continue long our civilization but for civilization survive need the wisdom the old einstein human global and seeing and whatever happens this unique crucial century will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the earth far beyond the earth here thank you very much
