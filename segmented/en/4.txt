this passionate talk legendary space craft designer burt rutan lambasts the government funded space program for stagn ating and asks entrepreneur pick where nasa has left off nasa aircraft business design engineering entrepreneur flight industrial design invention rocket science science space technology transportation burt rutan see the future space want start off saying houston have problem enter second generation progress terms human flight space fact regressed stand very big chance losing our ability inspire our out and continue this very important thing that species have always done and that instinctive gone out and climbed over difficult places went more hostile places and found out later maybe our surprise that that s the reason survive and feel very strongly that s not good enough for have generation kids that think that s look forward better version cell phone with video they need look forward exploration they need look forward colon ization they need look forward breakthroughs need inspire them because they need lead and help survive the future particularly trouble that what nasa s doing right now with this new bush doctrine for this next decade and half shoot screwed have real specific instruction here not talk about politics what looking forward what looking forward not only the inspiration our children but the current plan right now not really even allow the most creative people this country the boeing s and lockheed s space engineers out and take risk and try new stuff going back the moon years later and going very specifically planned not learn anything new really trouble that but anyway that s the basis the thing that want share with you today though that right back where inspire people who will our great leaders later that s the next minutes here and think that the inspiration begins when you very young three year olds year olds what they look the most important thing let s take snap shot aviation and there was wonderful little short four year time period when marvelous things happened started when the wright brother flew paris and everybody said ooh hey can that there s only few people that have flown early four years countries had hundreds airplanes thousand pilots airplanes were invented natural selection now you can say that intelligent design design our airplanes today but there was intelligent design really designing those early airplanes there were probably least different things tried and when they crash and kill the pilot don try that again the ones that flew and landed because there were trained pilots who had good flying qualities definition making whole bunch attempt thousands attempt that four year time period invented the concept the airplanes that fly today and that s why they safe gave lot chance find what s good that has not happened all space flying there s only been two concept tried two the s and one the russian well who was inspired during that time period aviation week asked make list who thought were the over and shake the first years aviation and wrote them down and found out later that every one them was little kid that wonderful renaissance aviation well what happened when was little kid was some pretty heavy stuff too the jet age started the miss age started von braun was there showing how mars and this was before sputnik and this was time when mars was hell lot more interesting than now thought there animals there knew there were plants there the color change right but you know nasa screwed that because they sent these robots and they landed only the desert you look what happened this little black line fast man ever flew and the red line top the line military fighters and the blue line commercial air transport you notice here s big jump when was little kid and think that had something with giving the courage out and try something that other people weren having the courage try well what did when was kid didn the rods and the girls and the dancing and well didn have drugs those days but did competition model airplanes spent about seven years during the vietnam war flight testing airplanes for the air force and then went and had lot fun building airplanes that people could build their garage and some those are flying course one them around the world voyager founded another company which company now and have developed more than one new type airplane every year since and there s lot them that actually can show you this chart the most impress airplane ever believe was designed only dozen years after the first operational jet stayed service till was too rusty fly taken out service treated back something that was developed what the most impress spaceship ever believe was lunar land was you know landed the moon take off the moon didn need any maintenance guys that s kind cool lost that capability abandoned this thing was designed three years after gagarin first flew space three years and can that now crazy talk very briefly about innovation cycle things that grow have lot activity they die out when they replace something else these things tend happen every years years long with overlap you can put that statement all kinds different technologies the interesting thing the way the speed here excuse higher speed travel the title these innovation cycle there none here these two new airplanes are the same speed the that was done here s the and that you don have innovation cycle the government develop and the government uses you know good example course the darpa net computers were used for artillery first then but when got now you have all the level activity all the benefit from private sector has keep that mind put down innovation looked for innovation cycle space found none the very first year starting when gagarin went space and few weeks later shepherd there were five manned space flight the world the very first year everyone that the united states sent space was killed there were only three four flight there were only two flight two russian flight the international manned station and had fly three mojave with little group couple dozen people order get total five which was the number the same year back there growth there s activity there s nothing this picture here taken from spaceship this picture here taken from orbit our goal make that you can see this picture and really enjoy that know how for sub orbital flying now safe enough least safe the early airline that can done and think want talk little bit about why had the courage out and try that small company well first all what s going happen next the first industry will high volume lot players there s another one announced just last week and will sub orbital and the reason has sub orbital there not solutions for adequate safety fly the public orbit the government have been doing this three government have been doing this for years and still four percent the people that have left the atmosphere have died that s you don want run business with that kind safety record very high volume think people will fly can tell you when this will start because don want competition know schedule but think once does will find solutions and very quickly you see those sort hotel orbit and that real easy thing which wing around the moon you have this cool view and that will really cool because the moon doesn have atmosphere you can elliptical orbit and miss feet you want s going much fun critics say hey rutan s just spend lot these billion aire money for ride for billion aire what s this this not transportation system s just for fun and used bothered that and then got thinking well wait minute bought first apple computer and bought because could say got computer house and you don what you use for come over does frog not the bank s computer lockheed s computer but the home computer was for games for whole decade was for fun didn even know what was for but what happened the fact that had this big industry big development big improvement and capability and and they get out there enough home were for new invention and the inventor this audience gore invented the internet and because that something that used for whole year excuse whole decade for fun became everything our commerce our research our communication and let the google guys think for another couple weekends can add dozen more things the list and won very long before you won able convince kids that didn always have computers our home fun defend able want show you kind busy chart but prediction with what s going happen and also bring another point right here there s group people that have come forward and you don know all them but the ones that have come forward were inspired young children this little three year old age going orbit and going the moon here right this time period paul musk richard jeff the ansari family which now funding the russian sub orbital thing bob private space station and these people are taking money and putting interesting area and think s lot better than they put area better cell phone something but they putting very areas and this will lead into this kind capability and will lead into the next really big thing and will allow explore and think eventually will allow colon and keep from going extinct they were inspired big progress but look the progress that s going after that there were couple examples here the military fighters had highest performance military airplane was the went whole life cycle got too rusty fly and was taken out service the concorde double the speed for airline travel went whole life cycle without competition took out service and stuck back here with the same kind capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that had back the late s but something out there inspire our kids now and talking about you got baby now you got year old now what s out there there s something really interesting going happen here relatively soon you able buy ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest performance military operational airplane s never happened before the fact that they have stuck here with this kind performance has been well you know you win the war minutes why you need something better but think when you guys start buying ticket and flying sub orbital flight space very soon wait minute what s happening here have military fighters with sub orbital capability and think very soon this but the interesting thing about the commercial guys are going first look forward new capitalist s space race let s call you remember the space race the s was for national prestige because lost the first two milestone didn lose them technically the fact that had the hardware put something orbit when let von braun fly you can argue that s not technical loss sputnik wasn technical loss but was prestige loss america the world saw america not being the leader technology and that was very strong thing and then flew shepherd weeks after gagarin not months decade whatever had the capability but america lost lost and because that made big jump cover well again what s interesting here lost the russian the first couple milestone already you cannot buy ticket commercial fly into space america can you can buy russia you can fly with russian hardware this available because russian space program starving and s nice for them get million here and there take one the seats s commercial can defined space tour they are also offer trip this whip around the moon like was done million bucks hey can the moon but you know would you have thought back the s when the space race was going that the first commercial capitalist like thing buy ticket the moon would russian hardware and would you have thought would the russian have thought that when they first the moon their developed hardware the guys inside won russian maybe probably japanese american billion aire well that s weird you know really but anyway think need beat them again think what see successful very successful private space flight industry whether first not really doesn matter the russian actually flew super transport before the concorde and then they flew few flight and took out service think you kind see the same kind parallel when the commercial stuff offered talk just little bit about commercial development for human space flight this little thing says here five times what nasa s doing want tell you already there s about billion billion investment private space flight that not government all already worldwide you read you google you find about half that money but there s twice that being commit out there not spent yet but being commit and planned for the next few years hey that s pretty big predict though profitable this industry going and certainly profitable when you fly people dollars something that you can actually operate tenth that cost less this going very profitable predict also that the investment that will flow into this will somewhere around half what the s taxpayer spend for nasa s manned space craft work and every dollar that flow into that will spent more efficient factor and what that means before know the progress human space flight with taxpayer dollars will level about five times much the current nasa budget for human space flight and that because s s private industry you should never depend the government this sort stuff and done for long time the before nasa never developed airline and never ran airline but nasa developing the space line always has and runs the only space line and shi away from because afraid but starting back june when showed that little group out there actually can can get start with everything changed after that time thank you very much
