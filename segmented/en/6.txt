genomics pioneer craig venter take break from his epic round the world expedition talk about the million genes his team has covered far it quest map the ocean s diversity dna bio here tech entrepreneur genetic invention ocean science technology craig venter dna and the sea the break was asked several people about comment about the aging debate and this will only comment and that understand that optimists great live pessimists what going tell you about minutes how about switch from reading the genetic code the first stage beginning write the code ourselves s only years ago this month when publish the first sequence free living organism that took genome project from years down four months can now that same genome project the order two eight hours the last decade large number genome have been add most human patho couple plant several sects and several mammals including the human genome genomics this stage the thinking from little over years ago was the end this year might have between three and five genome sequence s the order several hundred just got grant from the and moore foundation sequence genome this year side project from environmental organism the rate reading the genetic code has changed but look what s out there scratched the face what available this planet most people don realize because they visible but microbes make about half the earth s mass where all animals only make about one one thousand all the mass and maybe s something that people don very often but you ever make the sea and you swal mouth seawater keep mind that each milliliter has about million bacteria and the order million viruses less than micro species have been characterized two years ago and decided something about and started the rcerer expedition where were with great ocean ographic expedition trying sample the ocean every miles started rmuda for our test project then move halifax working down the s east coast the ibbean sea the panama can through the galapagos then across the pacific and the process now working our way across the indian ocean s very tough duty doing this sailing vessel part help excite young people about going into science the experiment are incredibly simple just take seawater and filter and collect different size organism different filter and then take their dna back our lab rock ville where can sequence hundred million letter the genetic code every hours and with doing this made some amazing discoveries for example was thought that the visual pigments that are our eyes there was only one two organism the environment that had these same pigments turns out almost every species the upper parts the ocean warm parts the world have these same photo receptor and use light the source their energy and communication from one site from one barrel seawater covered million new genes and many new species this the air now with grant from the loan foundation measuring how many viruses and bacteria all are breathing and out every day particular airplane close auditoriums filter through some simple apparat collect the order billion microbes from just day filter top building new york city and the process sequencing all that the present time just the data collect side just where are through the galapagos finding that almost every miles see tremendous diversity the sample the ocean some these make logical sense terms different temperature gradients this satellite photograph based temperature red being warm blue being cold and found there s tremendous difference between the warm water sample and the cold water sample terms abundant species the other thing that surprise quite bit these photo receptor detect different wavelengths light and can predict that based their amino acid sequence and these vary tremendous from region region maybe not surprising the deep ocean where s most blue the photo receptor tend see blue light when there s lot chlorophyll around they see lot green light but they vary even more possibly moving toward infrared and ultraviolet the extremes just try and get assess what our gene repertoire was assemble all the data including all our far from the expedition which represents more than half all the gene data the planet and total around million genes and tried put these into gene families see what these discoveries are are just discovering new member know families are discovering new families and turns out have about major gene families but every new sample take the environment add line fashion these new families the earliest stage dis very about basic genes components and life this planet when look the called evolution tree the upper right corner with the animals those roughly million genes only have around our genome and you take all animals together probably share less than and probably maybe dozen more thousand different gene families view that these genes are now not only the design components evolution and think gene centric view maybe going back richard dawkins ideas than genome centric view which are different construct these gene components synthetic dna the ability synthes dna has changed sort the same pace that dna sequencing has over the last decade two and getting very rapid and very cheap our first thought about synthetic genomics came when sequence the second genome back and that from coplasma genitalium and have really nice shirts that say you know heart genitalium this actually just micro organism but has roughly genes haemophilus had genes and simply asked the question one species needs another there smaller set genes that might com rise minimal operating system started doing transposon muta genes transposon are just small piece dna that ran insert the genetic code and they insert the middle the gene they rupt it function made map all the genes that could take transposon insert and called those non essential genes but turns out the environment very critical for this and you can only define essential non essential gene based exactly what s the environment also tried take more direct intellectual approach with the genome relate organism and tried compare all those see what they had common and got these over lapping circle and found only genes common all organism the pool expanded little bit ignored one trace llular par site expanded even more when looked set genes around think that can exp contract genome depend your point view here maybe genes from the minimal the only way pro these ideas was construct artificial chromosome with those genes them and had this cassette based fashion found that synthes izing accurate dna large piece was extremely difficult smith and clyde hutc colleagues this develop exciting new method that allowed synthes base virus only two week period that was percent accurate terms it sequence and it biology was quite exciting experiment when just took the synthetic piece dna jected the bacteria and all sudden that dna started driving the production the virus articles that turned around and then kill the bacteria this was not the first synthetic virus polio virus had been made year before but was only one ten thousand active and took three years this cartoon the structure this case where the software now build it own hardware and that s the notion that have with biology people immediate jump concern about biological warfare and had recent test imony before senate committee and special committee the s govern has set view this are and think s important keep real mind ver what happens with people s imagi nations basically any virus that s been sequence today that genome can made and people immediate freak out about things about ebola smallpox but the dna from this organism not infect even somebody made the smallpox genome that dna self would not cause infect the real concern that security department have designer viruses and there s only two countries the s and the form union that had major effort trying create biological warfare age that research truly continue there should very little activity the know how make designer viruses the future think single cell organism are possible with two years and possibly eukaryotic cells those that have are possible with decade now making several dozen different construct because can vary the cassette and the genes that into this artificial chromosome the key how you put all the other start with these fragments and then have homologous recombination system that assemble those into chromosome this derived from organism deinococcus radio durans that can take three million rads radiation and not kill assemble it genome after this radiation burst about hours after it chromosome are literally blown part this organism ubiquitous the planet and exist perhaps now out space due all our travel there this glass beaker after about half million rads radiation the glass started burn and cra while the microbes sitting the bottom just got happier and happier here s actual picture what happens the top this show the genome after million rads radiation the chromosome literally blown part and here s that same dna automatically assemble hours later s truly stunn that these organism can that and probably have thousands not ten thousands different species this planet that are capable doing that after these genome are synthes the first step just trans plant them into cell without genome think synthetic cells are going have tremendous potential not only for understand the biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues for example from the third organism sequence methanococcus jannaschii lives boil water temperature it energy source hydrogen and all it carbon comes from capture back from the environment know lot different pathways thousands different organism now that live off and can capture that back instead using carbon from oil for synthetic process have the chance using carbon and captur back from the atmosp convert that into polymer other products have one organism that lives off carbon monoxide and use reducing power split water produce hydrogen and oxygen also there s numerous pathways that can engineer metabol izing methane and dupont has major program with statoil nor capture and convert the methane from the gas field there into use products with short while think there s going new field called binatorial genomics because with these new synthes cap bilities these vast gene array repertoire and the homologous recombination think can design robot make maybe million different chromosome day and therefore with all biology you get election through screen whether you screen for hydrogen production chemical production just ability understand the role these genes going well with reach trying modify photo synthes produce hydrogen direct from light photo synthes modulated oxygen and have oxygen sensitive hydrogenase that think will totally change this process also com cell ulases the enzyme that break down complex sugar into simple sugar and fer ation the same cell for producing ethanol pharmaceutical production already under way major laboratories using microbes the chemistry from compound the environment order magnitude more complex than our best chemist can produce think future engineer species could the source food hopefully source energy environmental mediation and perhaps replacing the pet chemical industry let just close with ethical and policy studies delayed the start our experiment until com year and half ethical view whether should try and make artificial species every major religion participate this was actually very strange study because the various religious lead were using their scriptures law book and they couldn find anything them pro making life must the only ultimate concern were biological warfare aspects this but gave the ahead start these experiment for the reason were doing them right now the loan foundation has just fun multi stitutional study this work out what the risk and fits society are and the rule that scientific team such own should using this are and trying set good example forward these are complex issues except for the threat bio terrorism they very simple issues terms can design things produce clean energy perhaps revolution izing what develop countries can and provide through various simple process thank you very much
