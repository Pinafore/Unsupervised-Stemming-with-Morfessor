chris anderson the editor wired explore the four key stages any viable technology setting the right price gain market share placing establish technology and finally becoming ubiquitous business culture economics entertainment marketing shopping technology web chris anderson wired tech s long tail like speak about technology trend which something that many you follow but also follow for related reasons obviously being technology magazine technology trend are something that write about and need know about but also s part being any month magazine you live the future and have long lead time have plan issues many months advance have guess what public appetite are going six months nine months down the road the forecast business also like lot companies create product that s based technology trend this case our about ideas and information and lucky some entertainment but the concept s quite the same and have understand not only why tech s important where s going but also very important when the timing everything and s interesting when you look the prediction made during the peak the boom the s about commerce internet traffic broad band adoption internet advertising they were all right they were just wrong time almost every one those has come true just few years later but the difference few years stock market valu ations obviously extreme and that s why timing everything you probably seen something like this before this the classic gartner hype curve which talk about kind the trajectory technology s lifespan and just for fun put bunch technologies show whether they were kind rising for the first high peak whether they were about crash into the rough illusion ment rise back the slope enlighten ment etc and this one way technology forecast get sense where technology and then anticipate the next turn tend any technology that think sufficient important typically twice once want first want the first for the geeks who appreciate that catch right there the technology trigger you can see put linux the cover but then comes back and sufficient big technologies are going hit the mainstream and they going burst out and then s time again last year and that s one way that try time technology trend like talk about way thinking about technology trend that call grand ified theory predict the future but s closer ified theory predict the future s based the presumpti the observation even that all important technologies through four stages their life least one the four stages sometimes all four the stages and each one these stages can seen collision collision with something else for example critical price line that changes both the technology and also changes effect the world s inflection point and these are the inflection point that tell you what the next chapter that technology s life going and maybe how you can something about the first the critical price the first stage technology s advance that fall below critical price after fall below critical price will tend s successful rise above critical mass penetr ation many technologies that point displace another technology and that s another important point and then finally lot technologies comm towards the end their life they become nearly free each one those opportunity something about s opportunity for the technology change and even you missed you know the first boom you know did the critical price did the critical mass but hasn done displace ment yet and hasn done free yet there s still more opportunity that like demonstrate what mean this telling the story the dvd which technology which has done all these the dvd you know was introduced the mid s and was quite expensive but you can see that had fall below dollars and dollars was psychological threshold and started take off and you can see that the units started trend the hidden inflection point was taking off the next thing hit year later was critical mass this case percent often good proxy for critical mass household and what s interesting here that something else took off along with home theater units suddenly you have dvd the house you got high quality digital video you have reason have big screen television you have reason for dolby surround sound and maybe you have reasons for starting connect them and bring the rest your entertainment what s interesting also note that netflix was founded re ing here clearly saw that that was moment that was inflection point that could something with the next phase hit was displace ment you can see around finally out sold the vcr and here too you can see the implication the world large netflix was right the netflix model could capital the dvd way that the video rent store couldn among the dvd s many assets that s very small you can stick the mail and post cheaply that gave advantage that was implication the technology s rise that wasn obvious everybody and then finally dvd are approach free there s company called apex name chinese firm who has several times the past year been the number one dvd sell america their average price for last year was dollars you aware the perhaps apocryphal wal stamp over the dollar dvd but they getting very very cheap and look the interesting implication they get cheaper the premium brand the and such are losing market share and the name the apex are gain them they being comm ified and that s what happens when things zero s tough market out there now they introduced these four ways looking technology these four stages technology s life like talk about some other technologies out there just technologies our radar and use this lens these four way kind tell you where each one those technologies development they not necessarily the top technologies out there they just examples technologies that are each one these period but think that the implication them approach these crossover these intersect ions are interesting think about start with gene sequencing you probably know gene sequencing large part because s built computers falling price kind moore s law like level now possible will possible and craig venter indeed comes today may tell you something about this sequence the human genome for million dollars the end this year that s opposed billion just few years ago you know our ability capture the tools creation getting closer and closer what s interesting that the same time the number genes that discovering rising very quickly each one these genes has potential diagnostic test there will come day when you can have hundreds thousands test done very cheaply you want know you can learn about your own mosaic here s another technology that s approach critical price this fascinating research from who that shows the effect generic drugs anti retroviral drug compound and cocktail january the price was dollars dollars day the generic came first brazil and else where and the effect was just dramatic today s less than cents day and what s interesting you look the price elastic you look the ation between these two the anti retroviral come down the number people you can treat goes radical and the clinton foundation and who believe that they can treat three million people worldwide two million sub saharan africa and the falling price drugs has lot with that linux another good example now switch critical mass these are now technologies that are critical mass you look here here s linux red and s hit percent interesting s done crossover before but not the crossover that matter the crossover that s going matter the one with the blue but you can look and see the direction those lines are going you can see that the percent s now taken seriously s not just for the geeks any more that imagine what people redmond wake the middle the night thinking about another technology that see all around out here hybrid cars don know whether anybody has prius but they fantastic and you look the trend here about and don think this crazy forecast they two percent auto sales two percent isn percent but the car business which slow moving that s huge that s arriv two percent you start seeing them the road everywhere and what s interesting about the hybrid taking off you now introduced electric motor the auto mobile industry s the first radical change auto mobile technology years and once you have electric motor you can anything you can change the structure the car any way you want you can have generative king you can have drive wire you can have replace able body shapes s little thing that starts with hybrid but can lead whole new era the car voice over something you may have heard something about again s kind coming out where s little hard use right now there s company created the kazaa found called skype look these number they launched august last year they already have nearly four million register users that s critical mass and the same thing s happening the carrie side you looking taking over from some the traditional tele standards this tipping point malcolm s here give and s going change the economics and the speed and the players the industry s going look little bit like that and finally free free really really interesting free something that comes with digital because the production cost are essentially free comes with because s such efficient protocol comes with fiber optic because there s much bandwidth free really you know the gift silicon valley the world s economic force s technical force s deflation force not handle right abundance opposed city free probably the most interesting thing and here you have just the number song that can store hard drive you know there could film s unclear there but s basically every song ever made could store dollars worth storage takes that entire element the physical element song off the table and you seen the number mean you know the music industry implod front our very eyes and hollywood s worried well they facing force that they haven faced before and their response draconian and not necessarily the one that s going get them out this and finally give you one last example free perhaps the most powerful all mentioned fiber optic their abundance tend make things free this the price phone call india per minute and what s interesting that was just when was more than two dollars minute india had still has regul ated phone system and did was surprising non innovative moved very slowly but then there was just much fiber out there you couldn hold back and look how quickly the price fell s seven cents minute many case and the consequence cheap phone calling free phone calling india the piss off program the out probably one the most dramatic shift global ization and one the most powerful economic tools that seeing our world today the force india and then china and any other country that can contact our market and will work with our companies because the communication are free just beginning felt and think that s probably one the most important technology trend that looking today thank you
