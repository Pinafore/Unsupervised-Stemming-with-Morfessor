fumes from door cooking fires kill more than million children year the developing world mit engineer smith details exciting but simple solution tool for turning farm waste into clean burning charcoal featured macarthur grant alternative energy death design engineering global issues haiti industrial design invention smith shares simple life saving design terms invention like tell you the tale one favorite projects think s one the most exciting that working but think s also the simpl s project that has the potential make huge impact around the world address one the biggest health issues the planet the number one cause death children under five which water borne diseases diarrhea malnutrition s breath the smoke from door cooking fires cute respiratory infection caused this can you believe that find this shock and some what appalling can make cleaner burning cooking fuel can make better stove how that this can lead over two million deaths every year know bill joy was talking you about the wonder carbon nano tubes going talk you about the wonder carbon macro tubes which charcoal this picture rural haiti haiti now percent defores you see scene like this all over the island leads all sorts environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation couple years ago there was severe flood that led thousands deaths that s directly attribu table the fact that there are trees the hill stabilize the soil the rain come they down the river and the flood happens now one the reasons why there are few trees this people need cook and they harvest wood and they make charcoal order s not that people are ignorant the environmental damage they know perfectly well but they have other choice fossil fuel are not available and solar energy doesn cook the way that they like their food prepared and this what they you find families like this who out into the forest find tree cut down and make charcoal out not surprising there s lot effort that s been done look alternative cooking fuel about four years ago took team students down haiti and worked with peace corps volunteers there this one such volunteer and this device that had built the village where worked and the idea was that you could take waste paper you could compress and make briquettes that could used for fuel but this device was very slow our engineering students went work and with some very simple changes they were able triple the through this device you could imagine they were very excited about and they took the briquettes back mit that they could test them and one the things that they found was they didn burn was little discou raging the students and fact you look close right here you can see says s peace corps turns out there actually wasn any waste paper this village and while was good use government paper work for this volunteer bring back with him his village was kilometers away and thought perhaps there might better way come with alternative cooking fuel what wanted wanted make fuel that used something that was read available the local level you see these all over haiti well they small scale sugar mill and the waste product from them after you tract the juice from the sugarcane called bagasse has other use has nutrition value they don feed the animals just pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn what wanted was wanted find way harness this waste resource and turn into fuel that would something that people could easily cook with something like charcoal over the next couple years students and worked develop process you start with the bagasse and then you take very simple kiln that you can make out waste fifty five gallon oil drum after some time after setting fire you seal strict the oxygen that goes into the kiln and then you end with this carbon ized material here however you can burn this s too fine and burn too quickly useful for cooking had try find way form into useful briquettes and convenient one students was from ghana and remember dish his mom used make for him called kokonte which very stick porridge made out the cassava root and what did was looked and found that cassava indeed grown haiti under the name manioc and fact s grown all over the world yucca tapioca manioc cassava s all the same thing very star root able and you can make very thick stick porridge out which you can use bind together the charcoal briquettes did this went down haiti these are the graduate the first ecole chab charcoal institute and these that s right actually structor mit well and these are the briquettes that made now going take you different continent this india and this the most common used cooking fuel india s cow dung and more than haiti this produce really smoky fires and this where you see the health impact cooking with cow dung and biomass fuel kids and women are especially affected because they the ones who are around the cooking fires wanted see could introduce this charcoal making technology there well unfortunately they didn have sugarcane and they didn have cassava but that didn stop what did was found what were the local available source biomass and there was heat straw and there was rice straw this area and what could use bind was actually small amount cow which they used ordina rily for their fuel and did side side test and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung and you can see that s lot cleaner burning cooking fuel and fact heat the water lot more quickly and were very happy thus far but one the things that found was when did side side comparison with wood charcoal didn burn long and the briquettes crumbled little bit and lost energy they fell apart they were cooking wanted try find way make strong briquette that could compete with wood charcoal the market haiti went back mit took out the machine and figured out what sort forces did you need order compress briquette the level that you actually are getting improve performance out and the same time that had students the lab looking this also had community partners haiti working develop the process improve and make more accessible people the village there and after some time developed low cost press that allows you produce charcoal which actually now burn longer cleaner than wood charcoal now situation where have product which actually better than what you can buy haiti the market place which very wonderful place haiti alone about million trees are cut down every year there s possibility this being implemented and saving good portion those the revenue generate from that charcoal million dollars that s awful lot for country haiti with population eight million and average income less than dollars this where also moving ahead with our charcoal project and one the things that think also interesting have friend rkeley who s been doing risk analysis and s looked the problem the health impact burning wood versus charcoal and s found that worldwide you could prevent million deaths switch from wood charcoal cooking fuel that s remarkable but until now there weren ways without cutting down trees but now have way that s using agricultural waste material create cooking fuel one the really exciting things though something that came out the trip that took ghana just last month and this think the cool thing and s even lower tech than what you just saw you can imagine such thing here what this this corn turned into charcoal and the beauty this that you don need form briquettes comes ready made this laptop right here and actually like nick brought sample can pass these around they fully functional field tested ready roll out and think one the things which also remarkable about this technology that the technology transfer easy compared the sugarcane charcoal where actually have teach people how form into briquettes and you have the extra step cooking the bind this comes pre briquette and this about the most exciting thing life right now which perhaps sad comment life but once you see like you guys the front row all right yeah anyway here and this think perfect example what robert wright was talking about those non zero sum things not only you have health benefits you have environmental benefits but this one the incredibly rare situation where you also have economic benefits people can make their own cooking fuel from waste products they can generate income from this they can save the money that they were going spend charcoal and they can produce excess and sell the market people who aren making their own s really rare that you don have trade off between health and economics environment and economics this project that just find extremely exciting and really looking forward see where takes when talk about now the future will create one the things that think necessary have very clear vision the world that live and now don actually mean the world that live mean the world where women spend two three hours everyday grind grain for their families eat mean the world where advanced building materials means ment roof tiles that are made hand and where when you work hours day you still only earn dollars month mean the world where women and children spend billion hours year etching water that s the entire work force the state california worked full time for year doing nothing but etching water s place where for example this were india this room only three would have car this were afghanistan only one person this room would know how the use the internet this were zambia you would farmers you would have aids hiv and more than half you would living less than dollar day these are the issues that need come with solutions for these are the issues that need training our engineers our designers our business people our entrepreneur facing these are the solutions that need find have few areas that believe are especially important that address one them creating technologies promote micro finance and micro enterprise that people who are living below the poverty line can find way move out and that they not doing using the same traditional basket making poul rear etc but there are new technologies and new products that they can make small scale the next thing believe that need create technologies for poor farmers add value their own crop and need think our development strategies that not promoting educational campaign get them stop being farmers but rather stop being poor farmers and need think about how can that effectively need work with the people these communities and give them the resource and the tools that they need solve their own problems that s the best way shouldn doing from outside need create this future and need start doing now thank you chris anderson tell just while see someone has question just tell about one the other things that you worked smith couple other things that working are looking ways low cost water quality testing that communities can maintain their own water systems know when they working know when they treat them etc also looking low cost water treatment systems one the really exciting things looking solar water infection and improving the ability able that what s the bottle neck prevent this stuff getting from scale you need find entrepreneur venture capitalist what you need take what you got and get scale yeah think large number people moving forward s difficult thing s market place which very fragmented and consumer population with income you can use the same models that you use the united states for making things move forward and pretty small staff which you know what can with the students have students year out into the field and try implement this and move forward the other thing you have things with long time frame you know you can expect get something done year two years you have looking five years ahead but think with the vision that can move forward
