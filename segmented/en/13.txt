creativity culture design inter invention frank gehry ask then what frank gehry listen this scientist this morning mull was talking about his experiment and realized that almost became scientist when was parents bought chemistry set and decided make water made hydrogen generator and made oxygen generator and had the two pipes lead into beaker and threw match and the glass luckily turned around had all back and was about feet away the was covered with had explo richard saul wurman really people the street came and knocked the door see was okay like start this session again the gentle left the very famous perhaps over famous frank gehry and frank you come place your life which astonishing mean astonishing for artist for architect become actually icon and legend their own time mean you have become whether you can giggle because s funny you know s strange thought but your building icon you can draw little picture that building can used ads and you had not rock star status but celebr status doing what you wanted for most your life and know the road was extremely difficult and didn seem least that your sell out what they were were very big you kept moving ahead life where you depend working for somebody but that s interesting thing for creati person lot work for people the hands other people and that s one the great dilemmas creativity session s one the great dilemmas creativity how work that s big enough and not sell out and you achieved that and that makes your win doub big trip big s not quite question but you can comment s big issue well always just never really gone out looking for work always wait for sort the head and when started out thought that architecture was service business and that you had please the clients and stuff and realized when come into the meeting with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff and people would just look like just land from mars but couldn anything else that was response the people the time and actually was respond clients that had who didn have very much money they couldn afford very much think was circums tantial until got house where the client was wife bought this tiny little bunga santa monica and for like grand built house around and few people got excite about was visit with artist michael heizer out the desert near las somewhere s building this huge concrete place and was late the even had lot drink were stand out the desert all alone and thinking about house said did ever occur you you built stuff more permanent somewhere years somebody s going like thought yeah that s probably good idea luckily started get some clients that had little more money the stuff was little more permanent but just found out the world going last that long this guy was telling the other day where now back everything s temporary don see the way you characterized for every day new thing approach each project with new security almost like the first project ever did and get the sweat and start working not sure where going knew where was going would when can predict plan don card approach with the same trepid ation obviously over time have lot more conf ence that s going run kind business got people and you got pay them there s lot responsibil involved but the actual work the project with think health security and like the play wright said the other day could relate him you not sure when bilbao was finish and looked saw all the mistakes saw they were mistakes saw everything that would have changed and was embarrass felt embarrass how could have done that how could have made shape like that done stuff like that s taken several years now look detached and say you walk around the corner and piece work with the road and the street and appears have relationship that started like rsw what s the status the new york project don really know krens came with bilbao and explain all and thought was nut didn think knew what was doing and pull off think s icarus and phoenix all one guy gets there and then comes back they still talking about september gene some interest moving over ground zero and totally against that just feel comfort talking about building anything ground zero think for long time rsw the picture the screen that disney yeah rsw how much further along than that and when will that finish that will finish september october and hoping kyu and her and and all those guys come play with that place luckily today most the people working with are people really like richard koshalek probably one the main reason that disney hall came s been cheerleader for quite long time there aren many people around that are really involved with architecture clients you think about the world and even just this audience most are involved with building nothing that you would call architecture right and find one guy like that you hang him s become the head art center and there s building craig ellwood there knew craig and respect him they want add and s hard add building like that s beautiful minimal black steel building and richard want add library and more student stuff and s lot acre convince him let bring another architect from portugal alvaro siza rsw why did you want that knew you ask that question was intuitive alvaro siza grew and lived portugal and probably consider the port uguese main guy architecture visit with him few years ago and showed his early work and his early work had resemblance early work when came out college started try things context southern california and you got into the log span colonial tile roof and things like that tried understand that language beginning place jump off and there was much being done spec build and was trivialized much that wasn just stop mean charlie moore did bunch but didn feel good siza the other continue portugal where the real stuff was and evolved modern language that relate that his language and always felt that should come southern california and building tried get him couple job and they didn out like the idea collaborati with people like that because pushes you done with claes enburg and with richard serra who doesn think architecture art did you see that thing rsw what did say call architecture plumbing anyway the siza thing s rich experience must like that for kyu doing things with music s similar that would imagine where you huh audience liquid architecture liquid architecture where you s like jazz you improvise you work together you play off each other you make something they make something and think for s way trying understand the city and what might happen the city rsw going near the current camp going down near s near the current camp anyway s that kind patr s not his money course rsw what s his schedule that don know what s the schedule richard richard koshalek clear start from you can come the open invite you but the issue city building democracy interesting because create chaos right everybody doing their thing makes very chaotic environment and you can figure out how work off each other you can get bunch people who respect each other s work and play off each other you might able create model for how build section the city without sort the one architect like the rockefeller center model which kind from another rsw found the most remarkable thing preconcepti bilbao was this wonderful building you inside and there extraordinary space seen draw you had present here ted the surprise bilbao was it context the city that was the surprise going across the river going the highway around walk down the street and finding that was the real surprise bilbao but you know richard most architect when they present their work most the people know you get and you talk about your work and s almost like you tell everybody you good guy saying look worried about the context worried about the city worried about client worry about budget that time blah blah blah and all that stuff and s like clean your that you can saying all that means your work good somehow and think everybody mean that should matter fact like gravity you not going defy gravity you got work with the building department you don meet the budget you not going get much work leak bilbao did not leak was pro the project they were inter view for and they sent their facil ities people bilbao met them bilbao they came for three days rsw this the computer building yeah the computer building they were there three days and rain every day and they kept walk around notice they were looking under things and looking for things and they wanted know where the buckets were hidden you know people put buckets out was clean there wasn blood leak the place was just fantastic but you got yeah well until then every building leak this rsw frank had sort ask miriam sort had fame his fame was built that for while you all heard the frank lloyd wright story when the woman called and said wright sitting the cou and the water s head and said madam move your chair some years later was doing building little house the beach for nor simon and his secret who was kind wheels type lady called and said simon s sitting his and the water s coming his head and told her the frank lloyd wright story rsw didn get laugh not now either but point that and call the then what you solved all the problems you did all the stuff you made nice you love your clients you love the city you good guy you good person and then what what you bring and think that s what always been interested that which personal kind expression bilbao think show that you can have that kind personal expression and still touch all the base that are necessary fit into the city that s what reminded and think that s the issue you know s the then what that most clients who hire architect most clients aren hiring architect for that they hiring them get done get budget polite and they miss out the real value architect rsw certain point number years ago people when michael graves was fashion before teapot did teapot and nobody bought rsw did leak rsw people wanted michael graves building that curse that people want bilbao building yeah since bilbao opened which now four five years both krens and have been called with least opportunities china brazil other parts come and the bilbao effect and met with some these people say right away but some them come with pedigree and they sound well tentioned and they get you for least one two meeting one case flew all the way malaga with team because the thing was sign with seals and various very icial seals from the city and that they wanted come and building their port asked them what kind building was when you get here explain blah blah blah four went and they took they put great hotel and were looking over the bay and then they took boat out the water and showed
