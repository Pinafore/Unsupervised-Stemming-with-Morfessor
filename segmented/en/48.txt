inventor and macarthur fellow saul griffith shares some innovative ideas from his lab from smart rope house sized kite for wing large loads macarthur grant arts collaboration design innovation invention materials open source product design technology saul griffith everyday invention anyway who usually say people when they say what you say hardware because sort convenient encompass everything and recently said that venture capitalist casually some valley even which replied how quaint and sort really was dumb struck and really should have said something smart and now had little bit time think about would have said well you know look the next years and seen all these problems the last few days most the big issues clean water clean energy and they interchangeable some respect and cleaner more functional materials they all look hardware problems this doesn mean should ignore software information computation and that s fact probably what going try and tell you about this talk going about how make things and what are the new ways that going make things the future now ted send you lot spam you speaker about this that and you fill out all these forms and you don actually know how they going describe you and flash across desk that they were going introduce futurist and always been nervous about the term futurist because you seem failure because you can really predict and was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues have and said you know well have talk about the future what and george homsey great guy said the future amazing much strange than you think going program the bacteria your gut and going make your poo smell like peppermint you may think that s sort really crazy but there are some pretty amazing things that are happening that make this possible this isn work but s work good friends mine mit this called the standard biological parts this head drew and night and few other very very bright individual basically what they doing looking biology program able system literally think proteins routine that you can string together execute program now this actually becoming such interesting idea this state diagram that s extremely simple computer this one two bit counter that s essentially the computation equivalent two light switch and this being built group students rich for design competition biology and from the results the same competition last year university texas team students programmed bacteria that they can detect light and switch and off this interesting the sense that you can now then for statement materials structure this pretty interesting trend because used live world where everyone s said glib form follow function but think sort grown world you listened neil gershenfeld yesterday was lab associated with his where s really world where information define form and function spent six years thinking about that but show you the power art over science this actually one the cartoon write these are called work with fabulous illustrator called nick gotta took six years mit and about that many pages describe what was doing and took him one page and this our tucker s interesting little kid and his sister line and what s doing here observ the self assembly his cheer his real bowl and fact you can program the self assembly things starts chocolate dipping edge changing the rophobi city and the rophyli city theory you program those sufficient you should able something pretty interesting and make very complex structure this case s done self replication complex structure and that s what thought about for long time because this how currently make things this silicon wafer and essentially that s just whole bunch layer two dimensional stuff sort layer the feature side you know people will say unclear down around about nano meters now the right that s radio lara that s cellular organism ubiquitous the ocean and that has feature size down about nano meters and s complex structure could lot more with computers and things generally knew how build things this way the secret biology build computation into the way makes things this little thing here polymer essentially super computer designed for replicating dna and the ribo some here another little computer that help the translation the proteins thought about this the sense that s great build biological materials but can similar things can get self replicating type behavior can get complex structure automatically assembl organic systems because there are some advantage organic systems like higher speed semiconductors etc this some work how you autonomous self replicating system and this sort babb s revenge these are little mechanical computers these are five state state machines that s about three light switch line neutral state they won bind all now make string these bit string they will able replicate start with white blue blue white that code that will now copy from one comes two and then from two comes three and you got this sort replicating system was work actually lionel penrose father penrose the tiles guy did lot this work the s and lot this logic theory lay allow went down the digital computer revolution but s now coming back now going show you the hands free autonomous self replication track the video the string which was green green yellow yellow green set them off this air hockey table you know high science uses air hockey table and you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy but what you actually seeing copies that original string emerging from the parts bin that you have here got autonomous replication bit string why would you want replicate bit string well turns out biology has this other very interesting that you can take linear string which convenient thing copy and you can fold that into arbitr rily complex structure was trying you know take the engineer s version can build mechanical system organic materials that will the same thing what showing you here that can make shape the assemble from string components that follow extremely simple rules and the whole point going with the extremely simple rules here and the incredibly simple state machines the previous design was that you don need digital logic computation and that way you can scale things much smaller than micro chips you can literally use these the tiny components the assembly process neil gershenfeld showed you this video believe but show you again this literally the color sequence those tiles each different color has different magnetic polar and the sequence unique specifying the structure that coming out now hopefully those you who know anything about graph theory can look that and that will satisfy you that that can also arbitr structure and fact you know can now take dog and then assemble s linear string that will fold from sequence and now can actually define that three dimensional object sequence bit you know s pretty interesting world when you start looking the world little bit different and the universe now compiler and thinking about you know what are the program for program the physical universe and how think about materials and structure sort information and computation problem not just where you attach micro control the end point but that the structure and the mechanism are the logic are the computers having totally absorb this philosophy started looking lot problems little different with the universe computer you can look this droplet water having perform the computation you set couple boundary conditions like gravity the surface tension density etc and then you press execute and magical the universe produce you perfect ball lens this actually applied the problem there s half billion billion people the world don have access cheap glasses can you make machine that could make any prescription lens very quickly site this machine where you literally define boundary condition s ular you make sphe rical lens s elliptical you can make astigmatic lens you then put membrane that and you apply pressure that s part the extra program and literally with only those two the shape your boundary condition and the pressure you can define infinite number lenses that cover the range human refr active error from minus plus eight diopters four diopters cylinder and then literally you now pour monomer you know julia child here this three minutes light and you reverse the pressure your membrane once you cook pop out seen this video but still don know s going end right you reverse this this very old movie with the new prototypes actually both surface are flexible but this will show you the point now you finished the lens you literally pop out that s next year s yves you know glasses shape and you can see that that has mild prescription about minus two diopters and rotate against this side shot you see that that has cylinder and that was programmed literally into the physics the system this sort thinking about structure computation and structure information leads other things like this this something that people lab are working the moment called electronic rope literally you think about rope has very complex structure the weave and under load s one structure under different load s different structure and you can actually exploit that putting very small number conducting fiber actually make sensor this now rope that know the load the rope any particular point the rope just thinking about the physics the world materials the computer you can start things like this going segue little here guess just going casually tell you the types things that think about with this one thing really interested about this right now how you really taking this view the universe computer how make things very general sense and how might share the way make things general sense the same way you share open source hardware and lot talk here have spouse the benefits having lots people look problems share the information and work those things together convenient thing about being human you move linear time and unless lisa randall changes that continue move linear time that means anything you anything you make you produce sequence step and think lego the s nail this and they did most elegant but they can show you how build things sequence thinking about how can general the way make all sorts things you end with this sort guy right and think this applies across very broad sort lot concept you know cameron sinclair yesterday said how get everyone collaborate design global housing for humanity and you seen smith she talk about how you get students mit work with communities haiti and think have sort redefine and think how define structure and materials and assembly things that can really share the information how you those things more profound way and build each other s source code for structure don know exactly how this yet but you know s something being active thought about you know that leads questions like this compiler this sub routine interesting things like that maybe getting little too abstract but you know this the sort return our character this sort the universe different universe view that think going very prevalent the future from biotech materials assembly was great hear bill joy they starting invest materials science but these are the new things materials science how put real information and real structure into new ideas and see the world different way and s not going code that define the computers the universe s sort analog computer but s definitely interesting new worldview gone too far that sounds like s probably got couple minutes questions can show think they also said that extreme stuff the troducti may have explain that maybe that with this short video this actually square foot kite which also happens minimal energy surface return the droplet again thinking about the universe new way this kite designed guy called kulp and why you want square foot kite that s kite the size your house and you want that boat very fast been working this little also with couple other guys but you know this another way look the you abstract again this structure that defined the physics the universe you could just hang bed sheet but again the computation all the physics gives you the aero dynamic shape and you can actually sort almost double your boat speed with systems like that that s sort another interesting aspect the future
