vik muniz makes art from pretty much anything shredded paper wire cloud diamonds here describe the thinking behind his work and takes tour his incredible images art creativity design illusion vik muniz makes art with wire sugar was asked come here and speak about creation and only have minutes and see they count already and can minutes think can touch only very rather janitorial branch creation which call creativity creativity how with creation while creation sometimes seems bit grasp able even point less creativity always meaningful see for instance this picture you know creation what put that dog that picture and creativity what makes see chicken his hind quarter when you think about you know creativity has lot with causal too you know when was teenager was creator just did things then became adult and started know who was and tried maintain that person became creative wasn until actually did book and retrospective exhibit that could track exactly looks like all the crazi things that had done all drink all parties they follow straight line that bring the point that actually talking you this moment though s actually true you know the reason talking you right now because was born brazil was born monterey probably would brazil you know was born brazil and grew the s under climate political stress and was forced learn communicate very specific way sort semiotic black market you couldn really say what you wanted say you had invent ways doing you didn trust information very much that led another step why here today because really liked media all kinds was media junk and eventually got involved with advertising first job brazil was actually develop way improve the read ability bill boards and based speed angle approach and actually block text was very actually was very good study and got job agency and they also decided that had give very ugly plexiglas trophy for and another point why here that the day went pick the plexiglas trophy rented tuxedo for the first time life picked the thing didn have any friends way out had break fight apart somebody was somebody else with bra knuckles they were tuxedo and fighting was very ugly and also advertising people that all the time and well what happened when went back was the way back car the guy who got hit decided grab gun don know why had gun and shoot the first person decided his aggressor the first person was wear black tie tuxedo was luckily wasn fatal you can all see and even more luckily the guy said that was sorry and bribed him for compensation money otherwise press charge and that s how with this money paid for ticket come the united states and that s very the basic reason talking you here today because got shot well when started working with own work decided that shouldn images you know became took this very icon oclastic approach because when decided into advertising wanted wanted rush naked people ice for whiskey commercial that s what really wanted but they didn let just you know they would only let other things but wasn into selling whiskey was into selling ice the first works were actually objects was kind mixture found object product design and advertising and called them relic they were display first stux gallery this the skull remnant race very evolved race enter tainers they lived brazil long time ago this the anti stick unfortunately has become obsolete because was designed for atari platform play station the works maybe for the next ted bring the rock podium this the pre columbia coffee maker actually the idea came out argument that had star bucks that insisted that wasn having colombia coffee the coffee was actually pre columbia the bonsai table the entire encyclopedia britannica bound single volume for travel purpose and the half stone for people who are not dead yet wanted take that into the realm images and decided make things that had the same identity conflict decided work with cloud because cloud can mean anything you want but now wanted work very low tech way something that would mean the same time lump cott cloud and durer s pray hands although this looks lot more like mouse s pray hands but was still you know this kitty cloud they called equivalent after alfred stieglitz s work the nail but was still working with sculpture and was really trying flat and flat the teapot had chance florence think was and saw ghiberti s door paradise and did something that was very tricky put together two different media from different period time first got age old way making which was relief and worked this with three point perspective which was brand new technology the time and s totally over kill and your eye doesn know which level read and you become trapped into this kind representation decided make these very simple render that first they are taken line drawing you know something that s very and then did with wire the idea was because everybody over looks white like pencil drawing you know and they would look s pencil drawing then you have this double take and see that s actually something that existed time had physical and you start going deeper and deeper into sort narrative that goes this way towards the image this monkey with leica relaxation lux and the same way the history representation evolved from line drawing shaded drawing and wanted deal with other subject started taking that into the realm landscape which something that s almost picture nothing made these pictures called pictures read and named them after the amount yard that used represent each picture these always end being photograph the end more like etching this case this light house this yard after yard after hard rich and don know how many yard after john con table part from the lines decided tackle the idea point like which more similar the type representation that find photograph themselves had met group children the caribbean island saint kitts and did work and play with them got some photograph from them upon arriv new york decided they were children sugar plant ation workers and manipul ating sugar over black paper made portrait them these are thank you this valentina the fastest was just the name the child with the little thing you get know somebody that you meet very briefly valicia jacyn but another layer representation was still introduced because was doing this while was making these pictures realized that could add still another thing was trying make subject something that would interfere with the themes chocolate very good because has bring mind ideas that from ology romance and decided make these pictures and they were very large you had walk away from able see them they called pictures chocolate freud probably could explain chocolate better than was the first subject and jackson lock also pictures crowd are particularly interesting because you know you that you try figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily like face goes into becoming just texture paparazzi used the dust the whitney museum render some pieces their collection and picked minimal pieces because they about specific and you render this with the most non specific material which dust itself like you know you have the skin particle every single museum visit they dna this they will come with great mail list this richard serra bought computer and they told had millions color you know artist s first response this who count you know and realized that never worked with color because had hard time controlling the idea single color but once they applied numeric structure then you can feel more comfortable the first time worked with color was making these mosaic swat they end being very large pictures and photograph with very large camera camera you can see the surface every single watch like this picture huck close and you have walk very far able see also the reference hard rich s use color chart and the idea also enter another realm representation that s very common today which the bit map ended narrow the subject monet s hays tacks this something used joke you know make the same like robert smith s spiral and then leaving trace was done table tried prove that didn that thing the salt lake but then just doing the models was trying explore the relationship between the model and the original and felt that would have actually there and make some earth works myself opt for very simple line drawing kind stupid looking and the same time was doing these very large construction being meters away now would very small ones which would like but under the same light and would show them together the viewer would have really figure out what one was looking wasn interested the very large things the small things was more interested the things between you know because you can leave enormous range for ambigu there this like you see the size person over there this pipe hang and this another thing that did you know working everybody love watch somebody draw but not many people have chance watch somebody draw lot people the same time evidence single drawing and love this work because did these cartoon cloud over manhattan for period two months and was quite wonderful because had interest early interest theater that s just ified this thing theater you have the character and the actor the same place trying negotiate each other front audience and this you have like something that looks like cloud and cloud the same time they like perfect actor interest acting especially bad acting goes long way actually once paid like dollars see very great actor version king lear and felt really because the time the actor started being king lear stopped being the great actor that had paid money see the other hand you know paid like three dollars think and went house queen see version hello amateur group and was quite fascinating because you know the guy his name was grim person ated the moorish general you know for the first three minutes was really that general and then went back into plumber worked plumber plumber general plumber general for three dollars saw two tragedies for the price one see think s not really about impression making people fall for really perfect illusion much make usually work the lowest threshold visual illusion because s not about fool somebody s actually giving somebody measure their own belief how much you want fool that s why pay magic shows and things like that well think that s time nearly thank you very much
