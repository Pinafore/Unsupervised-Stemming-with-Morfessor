leadership philanthropy politics poverty social change third world bono s call action for africa well alex graham famous said his first successful telephone call hello that domi s pizza just really want thank you very much another famous man jerry garcia said what strange long trip and should have said what strange long trip s about become this very moment you are view upper half lower half appear different conference different country you can turns out two places once but still sorry can with you person explain another time and though rock star just want sure you that none wishes will include hot tub but what really turns about technology not just the ability get more song players the revolution this revolution much bigger than that hope believe what turns about the digital age what excite personally that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing you see used that you wanted make record song you needed studio and produce now you need laptop you wanted make film you needed mass equipment and hollywood budget now you need camera that fits your palm and couple bucks for blank dvd imagination has been decoupled from the old constraints and that really really excite excited when glimpse that kind thinking large what would like see idealism decoupled from all constraints political economic psychological whatever the political world has got lot learn from the digital world from the ease with which you wept away obstacle that one knew could even budged and that s actually what like talk about today first though should probably explain why and how got this place s journey that started years ago you may remember that song are the world they know s christmas band aid live aid another very grizzled rock star friend sir bob geldof issue challenge feed the world was great moment and utterly changed life that summer wife and myself went ethiopia went the quiet see for ourselves what was going lived ethiopia for month working orphan the children had name for they called the girl with the bear don ask anyway found africa magical place big skies big heart big shining continent beautiful royal people anybody who ever gave anything africa got lot more back ethiopia didn just blow mind opened mind anyway our last day this orphan man handed his baby and said would you take with you knew land that his would live and that ethiopia his would die was the middle that awful famine well turned him down and was funny kind sick feeling but turned him down and s feeling can ever quite and that moment started this journey that moment became the worst thing all became rock star with cause except this isn the cause six and half thousand african dying every single day from aids preventable treat able disease for lack drugs can get any pharmacy that s not cause that s emergency million aids orphan africa million the end the decade that s not cause that s emergency today every day more african will catch hiv because stigmat ization and lack education that s not cause that s emergency what talking about here human rights the right live like human the right live period and what facing africa unprecedented threat human dignity and equality the next thing like clear about what this problem and what this problem isn because this not all about charity this about justice really this not about charity this about justice that s right and that s too bad because very good charity americans like irish people are good even the poorest neighborhood give more than they can afford like give and give lot look the response the tsunami s inspiring but justice tough standard than charity you see africa makes fool our idea justice makes our idea equality mocks our pieties doubt our concern questions our commitment because there way can look what s happening africa and honest conclude that would ever allowed happen anywhere else you heard the film anywhere else not here not here not america not europe fact head state that you all familiar with admit this and s really true there chance this kind hemorrh aging human life would accepted anywhere else other than africa africa continent flames and deep down really accepted that african were equal would all more put the fire out standing around with water can when what really need the fire brigade you see s not dramatic the tsunami s crazy really when you think about does stuff have look like action movie these days exist the front our brain the slow extinguish count less lives just not dramatic enough would appear catastrophe that can avert are not interesting ones could avert funny that anyway believe that that kind thinking the intellectual this room six and half thousand people dying day africa may africa s crisis but the fact that s not the night news that europe you america are not treating like emergency want argue with you night that that s our crisis want argue that though africa not the front line the war against terror could soon every week religious extrem take another african village they attempt bring order chaos well why aren poverty breed despair know this despair breed violence know this turbulent times isn cheaper and smarter make friends out potential enemies than defend yourself against them later the war against terror bound the war against poverty and didn say that well said that now when the military are telling that this war that cannot won military might alone maybe should listen there s opportunity here and s real s not s not wish thinking the problems facing the developing world afford the developed world chance describe ourselves the world will not only transform other people s lives but will also transform the way those other lives see and that might smart these nervous dangerous times don you think that purely commercial level that anti retroviral drugs are great advertise ments for western ingenuity and technology doesn compassion look well and let s cut the crap for second certain quarter the world brand brand not niest the sign fizz and crack someone s put brick through the window the regional branch manager are getting nervous never before have the west been scrut ized our value have any our credibil these things are under attack around the world brand could use some polish and say that fan you know person who buy the products but think about more anti retroviral make sense but that s just the easy part ought but equality for africa that s big expensive idea you see the scale the suffering numb into kind difference what earth can all about this well much more than think can fix every problem but the ones can want argue must and because can must this the straight truth the righteous truth not theory the fact that our the first generation that can look disease and extreme poverty the eye look across the ocean africa and say this and mean not have stand for this whole continent written off not have stand for this and let say this without trace irony before back bunch hippie the s can change the world can you can individual but can change the world really believe that the people this room look the gates foundation they done incredible stuff unbelievable stuff but working together can actually change the world can turn the inevitable comes and transform the quality life for millions lives who look and feel rather like when you close sorry laugh here but you look different than you did haight ashbury the s but want argue that this the moment that you are designed for the flower the seeds you plant earlier head days ideas that you estate your this what excite this room was born for this moment really what want say you night most you started out want change the world didn you most you did the digital world well now actually because you possible change the physical world s fact economists confirm and they know much more than why then are not pump our fist into the air probably because when admit can something about got something about pain the arse this equality business actually pain the arse but for the first time history have the technology have the know how have the cash have the life saving drugs have the will hope this obvious but not hippie and not really one for the warm fuzzy feeling not have flower hair actually come from rock the clash wore big army boots not sandals but know toughness when see and for all the talk peace and love the west coast there was muscle the movement that started out here you see idealism detached from action just dream but idealism with pragmatism with roll your sleeve and making the world ben bit very exciting s very real s very strong and s very present crowd like you last year data this organization helped set launched campaign summon this spirit the fight against aids and extreme poverty calling the one campaign s based our belief that the action one person can change lot but the action many coming together one can change the world well feel that now the time prove right there are moment history when civilization redefine itself believe this one believe that this could the time when the world finally decide that the want loss life africa just longer accept able this could the time that finally get serious about changing the future for most people who live planet earth momentum has been building lurch little but s building this year test for all especially the leaders the nations who really are the line here with all the world history watching have been late appointed with the bush administration they started out with such promise africa they made some really great promise and actually have fulfill lot them but some them they haven they don feel the push from the ground the truth but appointment has much more perspective when talk american people and hear their worries about the deficit and the fisc well being their country understand that but there s much more push from the ground than you think got organized what try communicate and you can help you agree that aid for africa just great value for money time when america really needs putting the crassest possible terms the investment reaps huge return not only lives saved but good will stability and security that gain this what
