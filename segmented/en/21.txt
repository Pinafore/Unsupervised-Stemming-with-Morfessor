more nervous about what going say and about being the same stage all these fascinating people being the same stage who was the first person ever vote for and was getting pretty nervous and you know didn know that chris the stage and that s more ner wrack but then started thinking about family started thinking about father and grand father and great grand father and realized that had all these ted going through blood stream that had consider this element who chris kind mention started company with husband have about people inter national you looked the book you saw this which really was appalled and because wanted impress you all with slide since saw the great present ation yesterday with graph made graph that move and talk about the make besides this freak thing this science slide this math and this science this genetic this grandmother and this where get this mouth blogger which probably lot you means different things you may have heard about the kryptonite lock brouhaha where blogger talked about how you hack break into kryptonite lock using point and spread all over kryptonite had just the lock and they had address avoid too many customer concern you may have heard about rather which was basically the result blogger real izing that the not type old type write s word blogger expose this they worked hard expose this you know blogs are scary this what you see see this and sure scared and wear stage shit about blogs because this not something that s friend but there are blogs that are changing the way read new and consume media and you know these are great example these people are reach thousands not million reader and that s incredibly important during the hurricane you had msnbc post about the hurricane their blog dating frequent this was possible because the easy nature blogging tools you have friend who has blog digital pdrs personal record makes enough money just running ads support his family oreg that s all does now and this something that blogs have made possible and then you have something like this which inter last s wonderful organ ization people and doctor who develop nations offer plastic surgery those who need children with left pala will get and they document their story this wonderful not that car talk about myself that s what blogger have always decided that was going expert one thing and expert this person and write about and the short story about blog started was wasn happy with job because was designer but wasn being really stimulated was english major college didn have any use for but miss writing started write blog and started create things like these little stories this was illustration about camp experience when was years old and how went ymca camp chris camp and basically the end had made friend hate much that bunk they couldn find they sent search part and over heard people saying they wish had kill myself jump off bible peak you can laugh this this this what happened and when started blog was really this one goal not going famous the world but could famous people the internet and set goal said going win award because had never won award entire life and said going win this award the south south blog award and won reach all these people and had ten thousands people reading about life every and then wrote post about banjo wrote post about want buy banjo banjo which lot money and don play instruments don know anything about music like music and like banjo and think probably heard steve play and said could that and said husband said can buy banjo and s like and husband this husband who very hot won award for being hot told you can buy banjo you just like your dad who collect instruments and wrote post about how was him was such tyrant because would not let buy this banjo and those people who know under stood joke this mena this how make joke people because the joke this that this person not tyrant this person loving and sweet that let dress him and post picture him blog and knew was show this right now put this today would kill but the thing was wrote this and friend read and they like that mena she wrote post about you know want stupid thing and being stupid but got email from people that said god your husband such asshole how much money does spend year you could take that money and buy your banjo why don you open separate account been with him since was years old never had separate bank account they said separate your bank account spend your money spend his money that s and then got people saying leave him and was like what who are these people and why are they reading this and realized don want reach these people don want write for this public audience and started kill blog slowly like don want write this more and slowly and slowly and did tell personal stories from time then wrote this one and put this because einste today and going get choked because this first pet and she passed away two years ago and decided break from don really write about public life because wanted give her little memorial but anyway s these sort personal stories you know you read the blogs about politic about media and gossip and all these things these are out there but s more the personal that interest and this this who you see norman rockwell and you have art critics say norman rockwell not art norman rockwell hang living room and bath room and this not something consider high art and think this one the most important things humans these things resonate with and you think about blogs you think high art blogs the history paint about you know all biblical stories and then you have this these are the blogs that interest the people who just tell stories one story about this baby and his name odin his father was blogger and was writing his blog one day and his wife gave birth her baby week and never expect this one day was normal the next day was and this one pound baby odin was document every single day picture were taken every day day one day two you have day nine they talking about his apnea day gets pneumonia his baby small and never counter such just disturbing image but just just heart you reading this this happens day everybody read that s having failure breathing failure and heart failure and s down and you don know what expect but then gets better day goes home and you see this post that s not something that you going see paper magazine but this something that this person feel and people are excite about twenty eight comment that s not huge amount people reading but people matter and today health baby who you read his blog s deal his father s blog taking picture him still because still his and think his age level right now because had receive such great treatment from the hospital blogs what you probably heard these things before talked about the well and talked about all these sort things through our line history but think blogs are basically just evolution and that s where are today s this record who you are your person you have your google search where you say hey what mena trott and then you find these things and you happy happy but then you also find people s blogs and those are the record people who are writing daily not necessarily about the same topic but things that interest them and talk about the world flatten being this panel and very optimistic when think about blogs like got reach all these people million and hundreds million and billion people you know getting into china want there but you know there are many people who won have the access write blog but see something like the computer amazing because s blogging software simple have success company because tim and because perseverance but s simple stuff s not rock science and that s amazing thing consider the life record blog something that find incredibly important started with slide ted and had add this slide because knew that the minute showed this mom mom will see this somehow because she does read blog and she say why wasn there picture this mom have all the people that know but this basically the extent the family that know terms direct line showed norman rockwell paint before and this one grew with looking constantly would spend hours looking just the connect saying the little kid the top has red hair does that first generation there and just these little things this not science but this was enough for really interested how have evolved and how can trace our line that has always influenced have this record this census another grabowski that s maiden name and there s odore because there s always odore this all have have couple fact about somebody have their date birth and their age and what they did their house they spoke english and that s that s all know these people and s pretty sad because only back five generation and then s don even know what happens mom s side because she s from cuba and don have that many things and just doing this spent time the archives that s another thing why husband s saint spent time the washington archives just sitting there looking for these things now s line but through that and you have this record and you know this great great grandmother this the only picture have and think what have the ability with our blogs think about the people who are those computer talking about who they are shar these personal stories this amazing thing another photo that has great influenced series photo this project that s done argentinean man and his wife and s basically taking picture his family every for the past what god years twenty nine years there was joke original about graph that left out which you see all this math just happy was able add because that s kill set you have these people aging and now this them today last year and that s powerful thing have able track this wish that would have this family know that one day children will wonder grand children great grand children ever have children what going who was something that s very narcissistic blogger that amazing thing for because capture moment time every take picture myself been doing this since last year every single day and you know s the same picture s basically the same person only couple people read don write this for this audience show now but would insane this was really public about four people probably read and they tell you know you haven dated probably going get people telling haven dated but this something that s amazing because can back day can back april and say what was doing this day look know exactly s this visual cue that important what put the bad picture too because there are bad picture and remember instantly many this had for one day trip was sick and was hotel room and wanted not there and you see these things s not just always smil now kind evolved have this look you look river s license have the same look and s s pretty disturbing thing but s something that really important and the last story really want tell this story because this probably the one that means the most all what doing and probably get choked because tend when talk about this this woman her name was emma and she was blogger our service type and she was test she was there right when opened you know there were people and she wrote about her life deal with cancer she was writing and writing and writing and all started reading because had few blogs the service could keep track everyone and she was writing one day and you know then she disappear for little bit and her sister came and she said that emma had passed away and all our support staff who had talked her were really emotion and was very hard day the company and this was one those instance where realized how much blogging affect our relationship and flatten this sort world that this woman england and she lives she lived life where she was talking about what she was doing but the big thing that really influenced was her sister wrote and she said you know and she wrote this blog that writing her blog during the last couple months her life was probably the best thing that had happened her and being able talk people being able share what was going and being able write and receive comment and that was amazing able know that had empowered that and that blogging was something that she felt comfort doing and that the idea that blogging doesn have scary that don always have attack the blogs that can people who are open and want help and talk people that was amazing thing and and print out her sent pdf her blog her family and they passed out her memorial service and even her obitu they mention her blog because was such big part her life and that s huge thing this her legacy and think that call action all you you know think about blogs think about what they are think about what you thought them and then actually because s something that really going change our lives thank you
