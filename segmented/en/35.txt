nobel laureate james watson open ted with the frank and funny story how and his research partner francis crick discovered the structure dna dna culture genetics history invention science storytelling technology james watson how discovered dna well thought there would podium bit cared chris asked tell again how found the structure dna and since you know follow his order but light bores and you know wrote book say something say little about you know how the discovery was made and why francis and found and then hope maybe have least five minutes say what makes tick now back picture when was was the university chicago third year and was third year because the university chicago let you after two years high school you was fun get away from high school because was very small and was good sports anything like that but should say that background father was you know raised episcopalian and republican but after one year college became atheist and democrat and mother was irish catholic and but she didn take religion too seriously and the age was longer going mass and going bird watching walk with father early heard charles darwin guess you know was the big hero and you know you understand life now exists through evolution and the university chicago was ology major and thought would end you know was bright enough maybe getting from cornell ornith ology then the chicago paper there was review book called what life the great physicist schrodinger and that course had been question wanted know you know darwin explained life after got started but what was the essence life and schrodinger said the essence was information present our chromosome and had present molecule never really thought molecules before you know chromosome but this was molecule and somehow all the information was probably present some digital form and there was the big question how did you copy the information that was the book and from that moment wanted genetic understand the gene and through that understand life had you know hero distance wasn base ball player was linus pauling and applied caltech and they turned down went indian which was actually good caltech genetics and besides they had really good basket ball team had really quite happy life indian and was indian got the impression that you know the gene was likely dna and when got should and search for dna first went copenhagen because thought well maybe could become chemist but discovered chemistry was very boring wasn going anywhere toward you know saying what the gene was was just nuclear science and that s the book little book you can read about two hours and but then went meeting italy and there was unexpected speaker who wasn the program and talked about dna and this was maurice wilkins was trained physicist and after the war wanted physics and picked dna because dna had been determine the rockefeller institute possibly the genetic molecules the chromosome most people believed was proteins but wilkins you know thought dna was the best and showed this ray photograph sort crystal line dna had structure even though owe probably different molecules carrying different set instruction there was something universal about the dna molecule wanted work with him but didn want former bird watch and ended cambridge england went cambridge because was really the best place the world then for ray crystallography and ray crystallography now subject you know chemistry department mean those days was the main the physicist the best place for ray crystallography was the cavendish laboratory cambridge and there met francis crick went there without know him was was and within day had decided that maybe could take short finding the structure dna not solve like you know fashion but build model electro model using some coordinates you know length all that sort stuff from ray photograph but just ask what the molecule how should fold and the reason for doing the center this photograph linus pauling about six months before proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins and doing banished the man out the right sir lawrence bragg who was the cavendish professor this photograph several years later when bragg had cause smile certainly wasn smiling when got there because was some what humili ated pauling getting the alpha helix and the cambridge people fail because they weren chemist and certainly neither crick were chemist tried build model and knew francis knew wilkins wilkins said thought was the helix ray diagram thought was able with the helix built three strand model the people from london came wilkins and this collaborator possible collaborator rosalind franklin came and sort laughed our model they said was lousy and was were told build more models were competent and didn build any models and francis sort continued work proteins and basically did nothing and except read you know basically reading good thing you get fact and kept telling the people london that linus pauling s going move dna dna that important linus will know build model and then going scooped and fact written the people london could see their ray photograph and they had the wisdom say didn have but there was ones the literature actually linus didn look them that carefully but about months after got cambridge rumor began appear from linus pauling s who was cambridge that his father was now working dna and one day peter came and said was peter pauling and gave copy his father s manuscript and boy was cared because thought you know may scooped have nothing qualification for anything and there was the paper and proposed three strand structure and read and was just was crap this was you know unexpected from the world s and was held together hydrogen bonds between phosp hate groups well the peak that cells have around seven those hydrogen bonds couldn exist rush over the chemistry department and said could pauling right and alex said were happy and you know were still the game but were frightened that somebody caltech would tell linus that was wrong and bragg said build models and month after got the pauling manuscript should say took the manuscript london and showed the people well said linus was wrong and that still the game and that they should immediately start building models but wilkins said rosalind franklin was leaving about two months and after she left would start building models and came back with that news cambridge and bragg said build models well course wanted build models and there s picture rosalind she really you know one sense she was chemist but really she would have been trained she didn know any organic chemistry quantum chemistry she was crystallographer and think part the reason she didn want build models was she wasn chemist where pauling was chemist and crick and you know started building models and learned little chemistry but not enough well got the answer the february and was because rule which very good rule never the bright person room and weren weren the best chemist the room went and showed them pair done and jerry ohue was chemist said s wrong you got the hydrogen atoms are the wrong place just put them down like they were the books said they were wrong the next day you know after thought well might right changed the location and then found the base pair and francis immediately said the chain run absolute direction and knew were right was pretty you know all happened about two hours from nothing thing and knew was big because you know you just put next and next you have copy mechanism saw how genetic information carrie s the order the four base sense sort digital type information and you copy going from strand separating you know didn work this way you might well believe because you didn have any other scheme but that s not the way most scientists think most scientists are really rather dull they said won think about until know s right but you know thought well s least percent right percent right think about the next five years there were essentially something like five reference our work nature none and were left ourselves and trying the last part the how you what does this genetic information was pretty obvious that provide the information rna molecule and then how you from rna protein for about three years just tried solve the structure rna didn yield didn give good ray photograph was decided happy girl didn marry was really you know sort shit time there s picture francis and before met the girl still looking happy but there what did when didn know where forward formed club and called the rna tie club george gamow also great physicist designed the tie was one the member the question was how you from four letter code the letter code proteins feynman was member and tell and friends gamow but that s the only were only photograph twice and both occasion you know one was missing the tie there s francis the upper right and alex rich the turned crystallographer next this was taken cambridge september and smiling sort forced think because the girl had boy she was gone and didn really get happy until because then found out basically you know that there are three forms rna and knew basically dna provide the information for rna rna provide the information for protein and that let marsh niren berg you know take rna synthetic rna put system making protein made polyphenylalanine polyphenylalanine that s the first crack the genetic code and was all over there that s what chris wanted was what happened since then well that time should back when found the structure dna gave first talk cold spring harbor the physicist leo szilard looked and said are you going patent this and but knew patent law and that couldn patent because you couldn use for and dna didn become useful molecule and the lawyer didn enter into the equation until years later when and cohen francisco and stanford came with their method recombinant dna and stanford patent and made lot money least they patent something which you know could useful things and then they learned how read the letter for the code and boom you know had biotech industry and but were still long ways from you know answer question which sort dominated childhood which how you nature nurtu and already out time but this michael wigler very very clever math ematician turned physicist and developed technique which essentially will let look sample dna and eventually million spot along there s chip there conventional one then there s one made photo ography company madison called nimble which way ahead affymetrix and use their technique and what you can sort compare dna normal segs versus cancer and you can see the top that cancer which are bad show insert ions deletion the dna really bad muck where you have chance surviving the dna isn muck think that this will eventually lead what call dna biopsies before you get treated for cancer you should really look this technique and get feeling the face the enemy s not s only partial look but s think s going very very useful started with breast cancer because there s lots money for government money and now have sort vested interest want for prostate cancer you know you aren treated s not dangerous but wigler besides looking cancer cells looked normal cells and made really sort surprising observation which all have about places our genome where lost gene gain another one sort all imperfect and the question well around here you know these little loss gain might not too bad but these deletion ampl ations occurred the wrong gene maybe feel sick the first disease looked autism and the reason looked autism had the money looking individual about dollars and the parent child with asperger s disease the high intelligence autism had sent his thing conventional company they didn couldn conventional genetics but just scanning began find genes for autism and you can see here there are lot them lot autistic kids are autistic because they just lost big piece dna mean big piece the molecular level saw one autistic kid about five million base just missing from one his chromosome haven yet looked the parents but the parents probably don have that loss they wouldn parents now our autism study just beginning got three million dollars think will cost least before you position help parents who had autistic child think they may have autistic child and can spot the difference this same technique should probably look all s wonderful way find genes and conclude saying looked people with schizophrenia and thought probably have look several hundred before got the picture but you can see there s seven out had change which was very high and yet the control there were three what s the meaning the control were they crazy also and didn know you know were they normal would guess they normal and what think schizophrenia there are genes predispo sure and whether this one that predispo and then there s only sub segment the population that s capable being schizophrenic now don have really any evidence but think give you hypothesis the best guess that you left handed you schizophrenia percent schizophrenic people are left handed and schizophrenia has very funny genetics which means percent the people are genetic ally left handed but only half showed don have the time say now some people who think they right handed are genetic ally left handed just saying that you think don carry left handed gene therefore you know children won risk schizophrenia you might s extraordinarily exciting time ought able find the gene for polar there s relationship and had enough money find them all this year thank you
