dean kamen lay out his argument for the segway and offer peek into his next big ideas business cars education industrial design ovation invention robot science social change sustain ability technology third world transportation dean kamen inventing and giving you point out every time you come here you learn something this morning the world s expert from guess three four different companies building seats think conclu that ultimate the solution people shouldn down could have told them that yesterday the automotive guys gave some new sights they point out that believe was between and years from today they will ste cars wire without all that mechanical stuff that s reassur they then point out that there sort the other control wire get rid all that mechanical stuff that s pretty good but why not get rid the wire then you don need anything control the car except thinking about would love talk about the technology and some what s past the minutes happy talk all the tech geek around here about what s here but had one thing say about this before get first would that from the time started building this the big idea wasn the technology really was big idea technology when started apply the ibot for the dis community the big idea here think new piece solution fairly big problem transportation and maybe put that perspecti there s much data this happy give you different form you never know what strikes the fancy who but everybody perfect will believe the car changed the world and henry for just about years ago started crank out model what don think most people think about the context how technology applied for instance that time percent america lived either farm small towns the car the horse carriage that place the horse and carriage was big deal went twice fast horse and carriage was half long and was environmental improve because for instance they out horse and gies down manhattan because you can imagine what the road look like when you have million horse and million them urinat and doing other things and the typhoid and other problems create were almost imagi able the car was the clean environmental alternative horse and bug also was way for people get from their farm farm their farm town from town city all made sense with percent the people living there the s started connect all the towns together with what lot people claim the eighth wonder the world the highway system and certainly wonder and the way take old technologies want sure everybody and particular the automotive industry who s been very support that don think this any way com with airplane cars but think about where the world today percent the global population now lives cities that s billion people solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world get where are today years ago sailing ship started getting reli enough found new continent years ago locomotives got efficient enough ste power that turned the continent into country over the last hundred years started building cars and then over the years connected every city every other city extraordinarily efficient way and have very high standard living sequence that but during that entire process more and more people have been born and more and more people are moving cities china alone going move four six hundred million people into cities the next decade and half and nobody think would argue that airplane the last years have turned the continent and the country now into neighborhood and you just look how technology has been applied solved all the long range high speed high volume large eight problems moving things around nobody would want give them and certainly would want give airplane helicopter humvee porsche love them all don keep any them living room the fact the last mile the problem and half the world now lives dense cities and people spend depend who they are between and percent their energy getting around foot think there s don know what data would impress you but how about percent the refined fuel produce the world consume cars metropolitan are the united states three million people die every year cities due bad air and almost all articul polluti this planet produce transportation device particular sitting cities and again say that not attack any industry think really love airplane and cars highway moving miles hour are extraordinarily efficient both from engineer point view energy consumpti point view and util point view and all love our cars and the problem you get into the city and you want four lock s either fun nor efficient nor product s not sustainable china the year million people used bicycles million people used cars five percent that population became quot middle class and wanted the way gone the last hundred years the same time that percent their population are moving into cities the size and dens manhattan every six week isn sustainable environmental isn sustainable economic there just enough oil and s not sustainable politic mean what are fighting over right now can make complicat but what s the world fighting over right now seemed that somebody had work that last mile and was dumb luck were working ibot but once made this instantly decided could great alternative jet you don need the water mobiles you don need the s just fun and people love move around doing fun things and every one those dustries the way just golf car alone multi billion dollar industry but rather than license this off which what normal seemed that put all our effort not into the technology but into understand world that s solved all it other problems but has somehow come accept that cities which right back from ancient greece were mean walk around cities that were architect and built for people now have foot print that while solved every other transportation problem and s like moore s law mean look the time took cross continent conestoga wag then rail then airplane every other form transportation s been improve years gone back wards getting around cities they gotten big they spread out the most expensive real estate this planet every city wils boulevard fifth avenue par the most expensive real estate their down towns percent the land our cities are park cars the large cities the world you wonder what cities could give their pedestrian what take for grant now between cities what you could make them fun active clean environmental friend what would make little bit more pala table have access this that last link mass trans get out your cars can all live the urbs and use our cars the way want and then have our cities energize again thought would really neat that and one the problems really were worried about how get legal the sidewalk because technical got motor got wheels motor vehicle don look like motor vehicle have the same foot print pedestrian have the same unique ability deal with other pedestrian crowd space took this down ground zero and knocked way through crowd for hour pedestrian but the law typic lags technology generation two and get told don long the sidewalk have two choice recreational vehicle that doesn really matter and don spend time doing that kind stuff maybe should out the street front grey hound bus vehicle been concern about that went the post master general the united states the first person ever showed the side and said put your people everybody trust their post and they long the sidewalk and they use serious agree went number police department that want their police office back the neighborhood the carry pound stuff they love and can believe police going give themselves tick been working really really hard but knew that the technology would not hard develop attitude about what s important and how apply the technology went out and found some vision people with enough money let design and build these things and hopefully enough time get them accepted happy really happy talk about this technology much you want and yes s really fun and yes you should all out and try but could ask you one thing s not think about piece technology but just imagine that although all understand somehow that s reason that use our pound machine which can miles hour that can bring you every where you want and somehow s also what used for the last mile and s broken and doesn work one the more exciting things that occurred about why might get accepted happened out here california few week ago after launched were here with new crew nice beach zipping and back and s marvel the technology and mean while bicycles are zipping and skateboard are zipping and little old lady mean you looked the dicti little old lady came and now that this the eight normal adult now and she just stop and the camera there and she looks and says can try that and what was you know how are you going say anything and said sure get off and she gets and with little bit the then she turns around and she goes about feet and she turns back around and she s all smil and she comes back and she stop and she says final they made something for and the camera looking down her thinking wow that was great please lady don say another word and the camera down her and this guy has put the micro phone her face said what you mean that and figured s all over now and she looks and she says well she s still watch these guys she says can ride bike she says can use skateboard and never used roll blades she knew them name she says and s been years since cycle then she looks she s looking and she says and years old and don drive car more still have get the and can carry lot things and suddenly occurred that among many fear were not just that the bureaucracy and the regul and the legislators might not get was that fundamentally you believe there s pressure among the people not vade the most precious little bit space left the sidewalk these cities when you look the legal require for sidewalk then the eight foot for the park car then the three lanes and then the other eight feet s that little piece all that s there but she looks and says this and occur well kids aren going mind these things and they don vote and business people and then young adult aren going mind these things they pretty cool guess sub ally was worried that s the older population that s going worry having seen this and having worried about for eight years the first thing pick phone and ask our market and regul atory guys call aarp get point right away got show them this thing and they took washington they showed them and they going involved now watch how these things get absor number cities like atlanta where doing ials see really can fact help energize their down the bottom line whether you believe the united nations any the other think tanks the next years all human population growth this planet will cities asia alone will over billion people they learn start with cell phone they didn have take the year trip took they start the top the technology food chain got start building cities and human environment where pound person can couple miles dense rich green space environment without being pound machine cars were not mean for parallel park they wonderful machine between cities but just think about solved all the long range high speed problems the greeks went from the the dionysus the par their sandals you your sneakers not much has changed this thing goes only three time fast walk three time minute walk become minutes your choice when living city s now minutes because minutes you want alternative whether s bus train got build infrastructure light rail you going keep park those cars but you could put most cities and imagine how far you could you had the time walk one half hour s the city you could make fun and make eight minutes you can find your car park your car move your car park your car and somewhere you can get sub could change the way people ocate their resources the way this planet uses it energy make more fun and hoping some extent history will say were right that s segway this stirl cycle engine this had been conf lot things doing this little east right now producing few hundred watts electricity yes could attached this and yes kilogram propane you could drive from new york bost you choose perhaps more interesting about this little engine burn any fuel because some you might skeptic about the ability this have impact where most the world you can simply plug into your volt out been working this actually alternative energy source starting way back with john amp john run ibot because the best batteries you could get watt hours per kilogram lead watt hours per kilogram nickel cadmium watt hours per kilogram nickel metal ride watt hours per kilogram lithium watt hours energy every kilogram propane gas line which why nobody drive electric cars but any even you can burn with the same efficiency because s external com your kitchen you can burn any fuel turns out pretty neat makes just enough electricity for instance this which night enough electricity the rest the world holly holly point out can run computer and light bulb but more interesting the rmodynamics this say you never going get more than percent efficiency doesn matter much says you get watts electricity you get watts heat you wanted boil water and dense rate gallons hour take about little over kilo watts continu power that s much energy you couldn afford desalinate clean water this country that way certainly the rest the world your choice devastat the place turn everything that will burn into heat drink the water that s available the number one cause death this planet among humans bad water depend whose number you believe s between and people per day don need sophisticated heart trans plant around the world need water and women shouldn have spend four hours day looking for watch their kids die figured out how put vapor press dis this thing with counter heat exchanger take the waste heat then using little bit the electricity control that process and for watts which little more than half it waste heat will make gallons hour dis water from anything that comes into cool put this box here few years could have solution transportation electricity and communication and maybe drink water sustainable pack that ighs pound don know but try better shut
