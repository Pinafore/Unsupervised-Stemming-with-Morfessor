you never seen data presented like this with the drama and urge sports statistics guru hans rosling debunks myth about the called developing world africa asia google demo development economics global issues health statistics visual ization hans rosling shows the best stat you ever seen about years ago took the task teach global development swedish under graduate students that was after having spent about years together with african institution studying hunger africa was sort expect know little about the world and started our medical university karolinska institute under graduate course called global health but when you get that opportunity you get little nervous thought these students coming actually have the highest grade you can get swedish college systems thought maybe they know everything going teach them about did pre test when they came and one the questions from which learned lot was this one which country has the highest child mortality these five pair and put them together that each pair country one has twice the child mortality the other and this means that s much bigger difference than the uncertainty the data won put you test here but s turkey which highest there russia pakistan and south africa and these were the results the swedish students did got the confidence inter which pretty narrow and got happy course right answer out five possible that means that there was place for professor international health and for course but one late night when was the report really realized discovery have shown that swedish top students know statistical significant less about the world than the chimpanzees because the chimpanzee would score half right gave them two bananas with sri lanka and turkey they would right half the case but the students are not there the problem for was not ignorance was conceived ideas did also ethical study the professors the karolinska institute that hands out the nobel prize medicine and they are par with the chimpanzee there this where realized that there was really need communicate because the data what s happening the world and the child health every country very well aware did this software which display like this every bubble here country this country over here china this india the size the bubble the population and this axis here put fertility rate because students what they said when they looked upon the world and asked them what you really think about the world well first discovered that the textbook was tintin mainly and they said the world still and them and western world and them third world and what you mean with western world said well that s long life and small family and third world short life and large family this what could display here put fertility rate here number children per woman one two three four about eight children per woman have very good data since about the size families all countries the error margin narrow here put life expectancy birth from years some countries about years and there was really group countries here that was industrial ized countries and they had small families and long lives and these were the developing countries they had large families and they had relatively short lives now what has happened since want see the change are the students right still two types countries have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here have they got longer lives and live there let s see stopped the world then this all statistics that have been available here can you see there s china there moving against better health there improving there all the green latin american countries are moving towards smaller families your yellow ones here are the arab countries and they get larger families but they longer life but not larger families the african are the green down here they still remain here this india indonesia s moving pretty fast and the s here you have bangladesh still among the african countries there but now bangladesh s miracle that happens the s the start promote family planning they move into that corner and s have the terrible hiv epidemic that takes down the life expectancy the african countries and all the rest them move into the corner where have long lives and small family and have completely new world let make comparison directly between the united states america and vietnam america had small families and long life vietnam had large families and short lives and this what happens the data during the war indicate that even with all the death there was improvement life expectancy the end the year the family planning started vietnam and they went for smaller families and the united states there getting for longer life keeping family size and the s now they give comm planning and they for market economy and move faster even than social life and today have vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here vietnam united states the end the war think all don look the data under estimate the tremendous change asia which was social change before saw the economic change let s move over another way here which could display the distribution the world the income this the world distribution income people one dollar dollars dollars per day there s gap between rich and poor any longer this myth there s little hump here but there are people all the way and look where the income end the income this percent the world s annual income and the richest percent they take out that about percent and the poorest percent they take about two percent and this shows that the concept developing countries extremely doubt think about aid like these people here giving aid these people here but the middle have most the world population and they have now percent the income heard other forms and who are these where are the different countries can show you africa this africa percent the world population most poverty this oecd the rich country the country club the and they are over here this side quite overlap between africa and oecd and this latin america has everything this earth from the poorest the richest latin america and top that can put east europe can put east asia and put south asia and how did look like back time about then there was more hump and have most who lived absolute poverty were asian the problem the world was the poverty asia and now let the world move forward you will see that while population increase there are hundreds millions asia getting out poverty and some others getting into poverty and this the pattern have today and the best project from the world bank that this will happen and will not have divide world have most people the middle course s logarithmic scale here but our concept economy growth with percent look upon possibility percent increase change this and take gdp per capita instead family income and turn these individual data into regional data gross domestic product and take the region down here the size the bubble still the population and you have the oecd there and you have sub saharan africa there and take off the arab states there coming both from africa and from asia and put them separate and can expand this axis and can give new dimension here adding the social value there child survival now have money that axis and have the possibility children survive there some countries percent children survive five years age others only and here seems there gap between oecd latin america east europe east asia arab states south asia and sub saharan africa the linear very strong between child survival and money but let split sub saharan africa health there and better health there can here and can split sub saharan africa into countries and when burst the size country bubble the size the population sierra leone down there mauritius there mauritius was the first country get away with trade barrier and they could sell their sugar they could sell their textile equal terms the people europe and north america there s huge difference between africa and ghana here the middle sierra leone humanitarian aid here uganda development aid here time invest there you can for holiday s tremendous vari ation within africa which rarely often make that s equal everything can split south asia here india s the big bubble the middle but huge difference between afghanistan and sri lanka can split arab states how are they same climate same culture same religion huge difference even between neighbor yemen civil war united arab emirate money which was quite equally and well used not the myth and that include all the children the foreign workers who are the country data often better than you think many people say data bad there uncertainty margin but can see the difference here cambodia singapore the difference are much bigger than the weak ness the data east europe soviet economy for long time but they come out after years very very different and there latin america today don have cuba find healthy country latin america chile will have lower child mortality than cuba within some few years from now and here have high income countries the oecd and get the whole pattern here the world which more less like this and look how looks the world starts move this mao tung brought health china and then died and then xiao ping came and brought money china and brought them into the mainstream again and have seen how countries move different direction like this s sort difficult get example country which shows the pattern the world but would like bring you back about here would like compare south korea which this one with brazil which this one the label went away for here and would like compare uganda which there and can run forward like this and you can see how south korea making very very fast advance ment where brazil much slow and move back again here and put trail them like this you can see again that the speed development very very different and the countries are moving more less the same rate money and health but seems you can move much faster you are healthy first than you are wealthy first and show that you can put the way united arab emirate they came from here mineral country they ched all the oil they got all the money but health cannot bought the supermarket you have invest health you have get kids into school you have train health staff you have educate the population and say did that fairly good way spite falling oil price brought this country here got much more mainstream appearance the world where all countries tend use their money better than they used the past now this more less you look the average data the countries they are like this now that s dangerous use average data because there such lot difference within countries and look here can see that uganda today where south korea was split uganda there s quite difference within uganda these are the quintile uganda the richest percent uganda are there the poorest are down there split south africa s like this and down and look niger where there was such terrible famine last s like this the percent poorest niger out here and the percent richest south africa there and yet tend discuss what solutions there should africa everything this world exists africa and you can discuss universal access hiv medicine for that quintile here with the same strategy down here the improvement the world must highly contextual ized and s not relevant have regional level must much more detail find that students get very excited when they can use this and even more policy makers and the corporate sector would like see how the world changing now why doesn this take place why are not using the data have have data the united nations the national statistical agencies and universities and other non government organization because the data hidden down the database and the public there and the internet there but have still not used effectively all that information saw changing the world does not include public funded statistics there are some web pages like this you know but they take some nourish ment down from the database but people put price them stupid pass words and boring statistics and this won work what needed have the database s not the new database you need have wonderful design tools and more and more are added here started nonprofit venture which called link data design call gapminder from the london under ground where they you mind the gap thought gapminder was appropriate and started write software which could link the data like this and wasn that difficult took some person years and have produced animation you can take data set and put there are liberating data some few organization some countries accept that their database can out the world but what really need course search function search function where can copy the data search able form and get out the world and what hear when around done anthrop ology the main statistical units everyone says s impossible this can done our information peculiar detail that cannot search others can search cannot give the data free the students free the entrepreneur the world but this what would like see isn the public funded data down here and would like flower grow out the net and one the crucial point make them search able and then people can use the different design tool animate there and have pretty good news for you have good news that the present new head statistics doesn say s impossible only says can and that s quite clever guy huh can see lot happening data the coming years will able look income distribution completely new ways this the income distribution china the income distribution the united states almost overlap almost overlap and what has happened what has happened this that china growing s not equal any longer and s appear here over looking the united states almost like ghost isn huh s pretty scary but think s very important have all this information need really see and instead looking this would like end showing the internet users per this software access about variable from all the countries quite easily takes some time change for this but the axis you can quite easily get any variable you would like have and the thing would get the database free get them search able and with second click get them into the graphic form where you can instantly understand them now statistic doesn like because they say that this will not show the reality have have statistical analytic methods but this hypothesis generating end now with the world there the internet coming the number internet users are going like this this the gdp per capita and s new technology coming but then amazing how well fits the economy the countries that s why the dollar computer will important but s nice tendency s the world flatten off isn these countries are lifting more than the economy and will very interesting follow this over the year would like you able with all the public funded data thank you very much
