this stunning slideshow celebrate nature photographer frans lanting present the life project poetic collection photograph that tell the story our planet from erupt beginning present diversity sound track philip glass animals art arts design evolution fish nature photography storytelling frans lanting s ly rical nature photos nature s and s been passion photographer for national geographic port for many but five years ago went personal journey wanted visual the story life s the hardest thing ever attempt and there have been plenty times when felt like back out but there were also revelation and one those like share with you today went down remote lago australia hoping see the earth the way was three billion years ago back before the sky turned blue there s stromatolites down there the first living things capture photo synthesis and s the only place they still occur today going down there was like enter time capsule and came out with different sense myself time the oxygen exhale those stromatolites what all breathe today stromatolites are the heroes story hope s story that has some resonance for our time s story about you and nature and science and with that said like invite you for short brief journey life through time our journey starts space where matter condenses into sphere over time solidifying into surface molded fire the fire gave way earth emerged but this was alien planet the moon was closer things were different heat from within made geysers erupt that how the ocean were born water froze around the pole and shaped the edge the earth water the key life but frozen form late force and when vanish earth becomes mars but this planet different s inside and where that energy touch water something new emerge life arise around crack the earth mud and mineral become sub rate there are bacteria learn multiply thick places growing living structure under alien sky stromatolites were the first exhale oxygen and they changed the atmosphere breath that s fossil ized now iron meteorites deliver chemistry and perhaps membrane too life needs membrane contain itself can replicate and muta these are atoms single cell plankton with skeleton silicon circuit boards the future shallow sea nurtu life early and that s where morph into more complex forms grew light and oxygen increased life hard ened and became defensive learned move and began see the first eyes grew trilobites vision was refined horse shoe crabs among the first leave the sea they still what they done for ages their enemies long gone ions follow prey out the sea slugs became nail fish tried amphibian life frog adapted desert lichens arose fungi married algae cling rock and eating too transform land true land plants arose leaf less first once they learn how stay right they grew size and shape the fundamental forms follow bear spores that fore shadow seeds life flourish swamps land life turned corner jaws formed first teeth came later leather back and tuataras are echoes from that era took time for life break away from water and still all the time life turned hard could venture land and the drag that arose are still among today jurassic park still shimmers part madagas and the center brazil where plants called cycad remain rock hard forests arose and nurtu things with wing one early form left print like died only yesterday and others fly today like echoes the past birds life gain new mobility ngos covered continent migration got under birds witnessed the emergence flower plants water lies were among the first plants began dive and grew turning into trees australia turned into grass tree and hawaii daisy became silver word africa gondwana molded proteas but when that ancient continent broke life got tropical rain forests arose parking new layer inter dependence fungi multi orchids emerged genital shaped insects trick shared the largest flower earth evolution entwined insects and birds and plants ever when birds can fly they become vulnerable are and are these hawks trapped near antarctic extinction can come slowly but sometimes arrive fast asteroid hits and the world went down flames but there were witness survivors the dark when the skies clear new world was born world fit for mammal from tiny shrews came tenrecs accustomed the dark new forms became bats civets new predators hyenas getting faster and faster still grasslands created opportunities her safety came with sharp ened sense growing big was another answer but size always comes price some mammal turned back water uses adapted with layer fat sea ions got sleek and cetaceans moved into world without bound there are many ways mammal roo hop horse runs asia and wolf evolve tilt legs brazil prim ates emerge from jungle tarsiers first becoming lemurs not much later learning became forced band apes venture into the open and forests dried out once more going right became lifestyle who are brother mascu line chimps sister feminine bono are all them and more molded the same life force the blood our hands echo course water trace the earth and our brains our celebrate brains reflect tidal marsh life force own right new element and has alter the earth cover earth like skin and where doesn green land winter mars still not very far but that likelihood fade long ice melt again and where water liquid becomes womb for cells green with chlorophyll and that molecular marvel what s made difference power everything the whole animal world today lives stock pile bacteria oxygen that cycle constantly through plants and algae and their waste our breath and vice versa this earth alive and s made own membrane call atmosphere this the icon our journey and you all here today can imagine and will shape where next thank you thank you
