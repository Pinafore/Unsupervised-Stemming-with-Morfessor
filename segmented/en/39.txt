cambridge research aubrey grey argue that aging merely disease and able one that humans age seven basic ways says all which can avert aging biotech disease engineering future health care science technology transhuman aubrey grey says can avoid aging minutes absolutely brutal time limit going dive straight right the point where get this thing work here going talk about five different things going talk about why defeat aging desirable going talk about why have get our shit together and actually talk about this bit more than going talk about feasibility well course going talk about why are fatal istic about doing anything about aging and then going spend perhaps the second half the talk talking about you know how might actually able prove that fatal wrong namely actually doing something about going that two step the first one going talk about how get from relatively modes amount life extension which going define years applied people who are already middle age when you start point which can genuine called defeat aging namely essentially elimination the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are die the next year indeed get sick the first place and course the last thing going talk about how reach that intermediate step that point maybe years life extension going start with why should now want ask question hands anyone the audience who favor malaria that was easy hands anyone the audience who s not sure whether malaria good thing bad thing all think malaria bad thing that s very good news because thought that was what the answer would now the thing would like put you that the main reason why think that malaria bad thing because characteristic malaria that shares with aging and here that characteristic the only real difference that aging kill consider ably more people than malaria does now like audience britain especially talk about the comparison with hunting which something that was after long struggle the government not very many months ago mean know with sympathetic audience here but know lot people are not entirely persuade this logic and this actually rather good comparison seems you know lot people said well you know city boys have business telling rural types what with our time s traditional part the way life and should allowed carry doing s ecological sound stop the population explosion but ultimately the government prevail the end because the majority the british public and certainly the majority member parlia ment came the conclusion that was really something that should not tolerate civil ized society and think that human aging shares all these characteristic spades what part this people not understand s not just about life course s about healthy life you know getting rail and miserable and dependent fun whether not dying may fun really this how would like describe s global trance these are the sorts unbelievable excuse that people give for aging and mean not actually saying that these excuse are completely value less there are some good point made here things that ought thinking about forward planning that nothing goes too well that mini the turbulence when actually figure out how fix aging but these are completely crazy when you actually remember your sense portion you know these are argument these are things that would legitimate concerned about but the question are they dangerous these risk doing something about aging that they outweigh the down side doing the opposite namely leaving aging are these bad that they outweigh condemning people day necessarily early death you know you haven got argument that s that strong then just don waste time what say now there one argument that some people think really that strong and here people worry about over population they say well fix aging one s going die speak least the death going much lower only from crossing giles care less and therefore not going able have many kids and kids are really important most people and that s true and you know lot people try fudge this question and give answer like this don agree with those answer think they basically don work think s true that will face dilemma this respect will have decide whether have low birth rate high death rate high death rate will course arise from simply ject these therapies favor carrying having lot kids and say that that s fine the future humanity entitled make that choice what s not fine for make that choice behalf the future vacil late hesitate and not actually develop these therapies then are condemning whole cohort people who would have been young enough and healthy enough benefit from those therapies but will not because haven developed them quickly could deny those people finite life span and consider that that moral that s answer the over population question right the next thing now why should get little bit more active this and the fundamental answer that the pro aging trance not dumb looks s actually sensible way coping with the inevit ability aging aging ghastly but s inevitable you know got find some way put out our minds and s rational anything that might want that like for example making these ridiculous reasons why aging actually good thing after all but course that only works when have both these components and soon the inevit ability bit becomes little bit unclear and might range doing something about aging this becomes part the problem this pro aging trance what stop from ating about these things and that s why have really talk about this lot evange will far say quite lot order get people s attention and make people realize that they are trance this regard that s all going say about that now going talk about feasibility and the fundamental reason think why feel that aging inevitable definition aging that giving here very simple definition aging side effect being alive the first place which say metabolism this not completely logical statement s reasonable statement aging basically process that happens animate objects like cars and also happens despite the fact that have lot clever self repair mechanism because those self repair mechanism are not perfect basically metabolism which defined basically everything that keep alive from one day the next has side effects those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology that s fine definition can put this way can say that you know have this chain events and there are really two games town according most people with regard post aging they what calling here the gerontology approach and the geriatrics approach the geriatrician will intervene late the day when pathology becoming evident and the geriatrician will try and hold back the time and stop the accumul ation side effects from causing the pathology quite soon course s very short term strategy s losing battle because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant time goes the gerontology approach looks much more the surface because you know prevention better than cure but unfortunately the thing that don understand metabolism very well fact have pitiful poor understanding how organisms work even cells not really too good yet discovered things like for example rna inter ference only few years ago and this really fundamental component how cells work basically gerontology fine approach the end but not approach whose time has come when talking about intervention then what about that mean that s fine logic that sounds pretty convincing pretty iron clad doesn but isn before tell you why isn going little bit into what calling step two just suppose said that acquire let s say today for the sake argument the ability extra years healthy life people who are already middle age let s say going call that robust human rejuvenation what would that actually mean for how long people various ages today equivalent various ages the time that these therapies arrive would actually live order answer that question you might think s simple but s not simple can just say well they young enough benefit from these therapies then they live years longer that s the wrong answer and the reason s the wrong answer because progress there are two sorts technological progress really for this purpose there are fundamental major breakthroughs and there are incremental ments those breakthroughs now they differ great deal terms the predict ability time frame fundamental breakthroughs very hard predict how long s going take make fundamental break through was very long time ago that decided that flying would fun and took until actually work out how but after that things were pretty steady and pretty uniform think this reasonable sequence events that happened the progression the technology power flight can think really that each one sort beyond the imagination the inventor the previous one you like the incremental advance have added something which not incremental anymore this the sort thing you see after fundamental break through and you see all sorts technologies computers you can look more less parallel time line happening course bit later you can look medical care mean hygiene vaccine anti biotics you know the same sort time frame think that actually step two that called step moment ago isn step all that fact the people who are young enough benefit from these first therapies that give this mode rate amount life extension even though those people are already middle age when the therapies arrive will some sort cusp they will mostly survive long enough receive improve treatment that will give them further maybe years other words they will stay ahead the game the therapies will improving faster than the remain imperfect ions the therapies are catch with this very important point for get across because you know most people when they hear that predict that lot people alive today are going live more they think that saying that going invent therapies the next few decade that are roughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let live more not saying that all saying that the rate improvement those therapies will enough they never perfect but able fix the things that year olds die before have any year olds and the same for and and decided give this little name which longevity escape velocity well seems get the point across these ories here are basically how would expect people live terms remain life expectancy measured their health for given ages that they were the time that these therapies arrive you already even you and average year old probably can lot for you with these therapies because you too close death s door for the really initial experimental therapies good enough for you you won able with stand them but you only then there s chance that you might able pull out the dive and you know eventually get through this and start becoming biological younger meaningful sense terms your fulness both physical and mental and terms your risk death from age related causes and course you bit younger than that then you never really even going get near being fragile enough die age related causes this genuine conclusion that come that the first year old don know how old that person today because don know how long s going take get these first generation therapies but respect that age claim that the first person live subject course you know global catastrophe actually probably only about years younger than the first year old and that s quite thought right finally going spend the rest the talk last seven and half minutes step one namely how actually get this mode rate amount life extension that will allow get escape velocity and order that need talk about mice little bit have responding milestone robust human rejuvenation calling robust mouse rejuvenation not very imaginative and this what say going take long lived train mouse which basically means mice that live about three years average exactly nothing them until they already two years old and then whole bunch stuff them and with those therapies get them live average their fifth birthday other words add two years treble their remain lifespan starting from the point that started the therapies the question then what would that actually mean for the time frame until get the milestone talked about earlier for humans which can now explained equivalent call either robust human rejuvenation longevity escape velocity secondly what does mean for the public s perception how long s going take for get those things starting from the time get the mice and third the question what will actually how much people want and seems that the first question entirely biology question and s extremely hard answer one has very specul ative and many colleagues would say that should not this specul ation that should simply keep our counsel until know more say that s nonsense say absolutely are responsible stay silent this need give our best guess the time frame order give people sense portion that they can assess their priorities say that have chance reaching this rhr milestone robust human rejuvenation within years from the point that get robust mouse rejuvenation years from the robust mouse the public s perception will probably some what better than that the public tend under estimate how difficult scientific things are they probably think s five years away they wrong but that actually won matter too much and finally course think s fair say that large part the reason why the public ambivalent about aging now the global trance spoke about earlier the coping strategy that will history this point because will longer possible believe that aging inevitable humans since s been postpone very effectively mice likely end with very strong change people s attitude and course that has enormous implication order tell you now how going get these mice going add little bit descripti aging going use this word damage note these intermediate things that are caused metabolism and that eventually cause pathology because the critical thing about this that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology the damage itself caused going ly throughout life starting before born but not part metabolism itself and this turns out useful because can draw our original diagram this way can say that fundamentally the difference between gerontology and geriatrics that gerontology tries inhibit the rate which metabolism lay down this damage and going explain exactly what damage concrete biological terms moment and geriatrician try hold back the time stop ping the damage convert into pathology and the reason s losing battle because the damage continuing accumulate there s third approach look this way can call the engineering approach and claim that the engineering approach within range the engineering approach does not intervene any processes does not intervene this process this one and that s good because means that s not losing battle and s something that are within range being able because doesn involve improving evolution the engineering approach simply says let s and periodic ally repair all these various types damage not necessarily repair them completely but repair them quite lot that keep the level damage down below the threshold that must exist that causes pathogenic know that this threshold exists because don get age related diseases until middle age even though the damage has been accumul ating since before were born why say that range well this basically the point about this slide actually the bottom try say which bit metabolism are important for aging will here all night because basically all metabolism important for aging one way another this list just for illustration complete the list the right also complete s list types pathology that are age related and s just complete list but would like claim you that this list the middle actually complete this the list types thing that qualify damage side effects metabolism that cause pathology the end that might cause pathology and there are only seven them they categories things course but there s only seven them cell loss mutation chromosome mutation the mitochondria and first all like give you argument for why that list complete course one can make biological argument one can say what are made made cells and stuff between cells what can damage accumulate the answer long lived molecules because short lived molecule under goes damage but then the molecule destroyed like protein being destroyed proteolys then the damage gone too s got long lived molecules these seven things were all under discussion gerontology long time ago and that pretty good news because means that you know come long way biology these years the fact that haven extended this list pretty good indic ation that there s extension done however s better than that actually know how fix them all mice principle and what mean principle probably can actually implement these within decade some them are partial implemented already the ones the top haven got time through them all but conclusion that can actually get suit able funding for this then can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation only years but need get serious about need really start trying course there are some biologist the audience and want give some answer some the questions that you may have you may have been satisfied with this talk but fundamentally you have and read this stuff published great deal this cite the experimental work which optimism based and there s quite lot detail there the detail what makes confide rather aggressive time frame that predict here you think that wrong you better damn well and find out why you think wrong and course the main thing that you shouldn trust people who call themselves geront ologists because with any radical from previous thinking within particular field you know you expect people the mainstream bit resistant and not really take seriously you know you got actually your homework order understand whether this true and just end with few things one thing you know you hearing from guy the next session who said some time ago that could sequence the human genome half time and everyone said well s obviously impossible and you know what happened you know this does happen have various strategies there s the methuselah mouse prize which basically incentive innovate and what you think going work and you get money for you win there s proposal actually put together institute this what s going take bit money but mean look how long does take spend that the war iraq not very long s got philanthropic because profit tract biotech but s basically got percent chance think succeed this and think know how and stop there thank you chris anderson don know there s going any questions but thought would give people the chance audience since you been talking about aging and trying defeat why that you make yourself appear like old man because old man actually audience species this planet have evolved with immune systems fight off all the diseases that individual live long enough create however far know all the species have evolved actually die when cells divide the telom erase get short and eventually species die why does evolution has seems have elected against immortal when advantage evolution just complete brilliant thank you for asking question that can answer with controversial answer going tell you the genuine mainstream answer your question which happen agree with which that aging not product selection evolution aging simply product evolutionary neglect other words have aging because s hard work not have aging you need more genetic pathway more sophistication your genes order age more slowly and that carrie being true the longer you push out the extent that evolution doesn matter doesn care whether genes are passed individual living long time creation there s certain amount modul ation that which why different species have different lifespan but that s why there are immortal species the genes don care but that s right audience hello read somewhere that the last years the average lifespan basically anyone the planet has grown years project that that would make think that would live until don crash motor bike that means that one your subject become year old you lose bit weight your number are bit out the standard number are that lifespan have been growing between one and two years per decade s not quite good you might think you might hope but tend move one year per year soon possible audience was told that many the brain cells have adults are actually the human embryo and that the brain cells last years that indeed true biological are there implication the world rejuvenation there are cells body that live all years opposed typical you know couple months there are technical implication certainly basically what need replace cells those few areas the brain that lose cells respect able rate especially neurons but don want replace them any faster than that not much faster anyway because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function what said about there being non aging species earlier was little bit over simpl ation there are species that have aging for example but they not having nervous system and not having any tissue fact that re for their function very long lived cells
