free press paper magazine radio blogs the back bone any true democracy sasa vucinic journalist from grade talk about his new fund which support media selling free press bonds business culture global issues investment media philanthropy sasa vucinic invest free press video narrator even seen from one point view gives one impression seen from another point view gives quite different impression but s only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what s going sasha vucinic s great clip isn and found that seconds tells more about the power and importance independent media than could say hour thought that will good start with and also start with little bit statistics according relevant research percent the population this planet lives the societies without independent press think about that number percent the population the whole planet does not really know what going their countries the information they get gets filter through somebody who either twist that information color that information does something with they deprived understanding their reality that just understand how big and important this problem now those you who are lucky enough live those societies that represent percent think should enjoy until last you know morning you flick the paper get your cappuccino enjoy while last because heard yesterday countries can lose stars from their flag but they can also lose press freedom guess americans among can tell more about but that s totally another and separate topic can back story story starts the story want share starts that time was running the only independent for that matter the only electronic media the country and guess were sharing had that regular life the only independent media the country operating hostile environment where government really want make your life miserable and there are different ways yeah was the usual cocktail little bit threat little bit friendly advice little bit financial police little bit text control you always have somebody who never leave your office but what they really which very powerful and that what government the late s started doing they don like independent media companies you know they threat your advertise once they threat your advertise market forces are actually you know destroyed and the advertise not want come matter how much does make sense for them not want come and advertise and you have problem making end meet that time the beginning the s had that problem which was you know survival below one side but what was really painful for was remember the beginning the s yugoslavia falling apart were sitting over there with country down fall slow motion down fall and all had all that tape had the ability understand what was going were actually record history the problem was that had tape that history week later because did not could not afford enough tape keep archive that history gave you that picture don want too long that that context gentleman came office that time was still was running media systems organization which still business the gentleman still business and what did know that time about media systems would think media systems were organization which means they should help you prepared two plans for that meeting two strategic plans the small one and the big one the small one was just wanted him help get those damn tape can keep that archive for the next years the big plan was ask him for dollar loan because thought still maintain that serious and independent media companies are great business and thought that will survive and great company once milosevic gone which turned out true s now probably either the biggest the second biggest media company the country and thought that the only thing that needed that time was dollar loan take through those hard times make long story short the gentleman comes into the office great suit and tie gave him what thought was brilliant explanation the political situation and explained how hard and difficult the war will actually under estimate the atroc ities have admit anyway after that whole big long explanation the only question had for and this not joke are paying royal ties after broad cast music michael jackson that was really the only question had left and remember being actually very angry myself because thought there must institution the world that providing loan media companies s obvious straight your face and somebody must have thought somebody must have started something like that and thought just dumb and cannot find you know defense there was google that time you could not just google thought that that s actually problem now from here fast forward have left the country have meeting with george soros trying for the third time convince him that his foundation should invest something that should operate like media bank and basically what was saying very simple you know about charity doesn work about hand dollars not help anybody what you should you should treat media companies business s business anywhere media business any other business needs capital ized and what these guys need actually access capital third meeting argument are pretty well exercise the end the meeting says look not going work you will never see your money back but foundation will put dollars you can test the idea see that will not work said give you rope hang yourself knew two things after that meeting first under circumstances want hang myself and second that have idea how make work you see the level concept was great concept but s one thing have concept s totally separate thing actually make work had absolutely idea how that could actually work had the wrong idea thought that can bank you see bank don know there are any bank over here apologize advance but s the best job the world you know you find somebody who respect able and has lot money you give them more money they you that over time you collect interest and nothing between thought why don get into that business here are having our first client brilliant first independent newspaper slovakia the government cutting them off from all the printing facilities lava here s the daily newspaper that has printed kilometers away from the capital s daily newspaper with dead line that means that they have sports they have latest news circulation goes down s kind very nice sophisticated way how economically angle daily newspaper they come with quest for loan they want the only way for them survive get printing press and said that s fine let s meet you bring your business plan which eventually they did start the meeting get these two pieces paper not like this form s much bigger lot number there lot number but however you put you know the number not make any sense and that s the best they could were the best that they could that how understood what our method s not bank had actually into these companies and earn our return fix them establish management systems providing all that knowledge how you run business one side while they all know how run how create content just quickly the results over these years million dollars afford able financing average interest rate five percent six percent lately are going wild charging seven percent from time time countries the developing world and here the most stunning number return rate the one that soros was worried about percent percent all the schedule ments came back time what typically finance finance anything that media company would need from printing press transmitters what most important either form loan ities lease whatever appropriate for you know support anybody but what most important here who finance believe that the last years companies that finance are actually the best media companies the developing world that who who list and could spend hours talking about them because they all kind heroes and can but give you just maybe one and depending time may give you two examples who work with you see started working eastern and central europe and moved russia our first loan russia was chelyabinsk half you have never heard that place the south russia there s guy called boris nikolayevich kirsh who running independent newspaper there the city was closed until early s because all things they were producing glass for tupolev planes anyway s running independent newspaper there after two years working with becomes the most respect newspaper that small place governor comes him one day actually invite him come his office goes and see the governor the governor says boris nikolayevich understand you are doing great job and you are the most respect newspaper our district and want offer you deal can you please give your newspaper for the next nine months because have election there are election coming nine months will not run but s very important for who going succeed give the paper for nine months give back you have interest being media business how much would that cost boris nikolayevich says s not for sale the governor says will close you boris nikolayevich says you cannot six months later the newspaper was closed luckily had enough time help boris nikolayevich take all the assets out that company and bring him into new one get all the subscription lists hire staff what the governor got was empty shell but that what happens you business independent media and you are bank for independent media sounds like great story somewhere down the road opened media management center started our media lab sounds like real great story but there second angle that the second angle like this clip you take the camera above you start thinking about these number again million dollars over years spread over countries that not too much s actually just drop the sea because when you think about the importance some the issues that were talking about last night this last session had about africa and his hypothetical billion dollars destined for africa all those not all half those problems mentioned last night government account ability corruption how you fight corruption giving voice heard poor s why independent media business and s why was invented from that perspective what did just really one drop the sea that need that can identify now our just one story sure that this room there are like other wonderful stories nonprofit doing spectacular work here where the problem and explain you well can what the problem and s called fund raising imagine that this third this room filled with people who represent different foundation imagine two third over here running excellent organization doing very important work now imagine that every second person over here deaf does not hear and switch the light off now that how difficult match people from this side the room with people that side the room thought that some kind big idea needed form totally think fund raising you know instead people running this dark trying find their own match who will willing who has the same goal instead all that thought there something new needs invented and came with this idea bonds press freedom bonds there are investors willing finance s government budget deficit why wouldn find investors willing finance press freedom deficit decided this fall will issue them probably denomi nations dollars don want advertise them too much that s not the point but the point ever survive actually issue them find enough investors that this can considered success there s nothing stop ping the next organization start issue bonds next spring and those can environmental bonds and then two weeks later iqbal quadir can issue his electricity bangladesh bonds and before you know any social cause can actually finance this way now dreaming with seconds left but let s take the idea further you you start the states because s you know concept are very very close american minds but you can actually bring europe too you can bring asia you can once you have all those different point you can make easy for investors put all those bonds one place and they down and click once you have more than them you have develop some kind matrix what investors get one side financial the other side social that bring the idea some kind rating agency morning star type says you know social impact over here spectacular five stars financial they give you one percent only one star now take the last step once you have all that put together there s not one reason why you couldn actually have market place for all that where you cannot dispose all those bonds pretty quick way and that way you organize the financing there are dark room blind people running around find each other thank you
