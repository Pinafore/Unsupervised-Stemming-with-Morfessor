emotionally charged talk macarthur winning activist major details her fight for environmental justice the south bronx and shows how minor neighborhood suffer most from flawed urban policy featured macarthur grant new york activism business cities environment green politics pollution major green the ghetto you here today and very happy that you are you all heard about how sustainable development will save from ourselves however when not ted are often told that real sustainability policy agenda just not feasible especially large urban areas like new york city and that s because most people with decision making power both the public and the private sector really don feel though they danger the reason why here today part because dog abandoned puppy found back the rain back she turned out much bigger dog than anticipate when she came into life were fighting against huge waste facility planned for the east river water front despite the fact that our small part new york city already handle more than percent the entire city s commercial waste treatment izing plant sludge plant four power plants the world s largest food distribution center well other industries that bring more than diesel truck trips the area each week the area also has one the lowest ratios parks people the city when was contact the parks department about seed grant initiative seed grant initiative help develop water front projects thought they were really well meaning but bit naive lived this area all life and you could not get the river because all the love facilities that mentioned earlier then while ging with dog one morning she pulled into what thought was just another illegal dump there were and pile garbage and other stuff that won mention here but she kept dragging and and hold the end that lot was the river knew that this forgotten little street end abandoned like the dog that brought there was worth saving and knew would grow become the proud beginning the community led vital ization the new south bronx and just like new dog was idea that got bigger than imagine garnered much support along the way and the hunt point river side park became the first water front park that the south bronx had had more than years leverage that seed grant more than times into million park and the fall actually going exchange marriage vows with loved thank you very much that s him press button back there which does all the time but those living environmental justice communities are the the coal mine feel the problems right now and have for some time environmental justice for those you who may not familiar with the term goes something like this community should saddle with more environmental burden and less environmental benefits than any other unfortunately race and class are extremely reliable indic ators where one might find the good stuff like parks and trees and where one might find the bad stuff like power plants and waste facilities black person america twice likely white person live area where air pollution poses the greatest risk health five times more likely live within walking distance power plant chemical facility which these land use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead problems like obesity diabetes and asthma why would someone leave their home for risk walk toxic neighborhood our percent obesity rate high even for this country and diabetes comes with one out four south bronx children has asthma our asthma hospital ization rate seven times higher than the national average these impact are coming everyone s way and all pay dear for solid waste cost health problems associated with pollution and more ious the cost prison our young black and latino men who possess told amount potential percent our residents live below the poverty line percent are employed low income citizens often use emergency room visit primary care this comes high cost taxpayer and produce portion benefits poor people are not only still poor they are still healthy fortunately there are many people like who are striving for solutions that won compromise the lives low income communities color the short term and won destroy all the long term none want that and all have that common what else have common well first all all incredibly good looking graduate high school college post graduate degrees travel interesting places didn have kids your early teen financial table never been imprisoned good but besides being black woman different from most you some other ways watched nearly half the buildings neighborhood burn down big brother lenny fought vietnam only down few block from our home jesus grew with crack house across the street yeah poor black child from the ghetto these things make different from you but the things have common set apart from most the people community and between these two world with enough heart fight for justice the other how did things get different for the late s dad pull port slave bought house the hunt point section the south bronx and few years later married mom the time the community was mostly white working class neighborhood dad was not alone and others like him pursue their own version the american dream white flight became common the south bronx and many cities around the country red lining was used bank where certain section the city including our were off limits any sort investment many landlord believed was more profitable their buildings and collect insurance money rather than sell under those conditions dead injured former ants standing hunt point was former walk work community but now residents had neither work nor home walk national highway construction boom was added our problems new york state robert moses spear head aggressive highway expansion campaign one primary goal was make easier for residents wealthy communities westchester count manhattan the south bronx which lies between did not stand chance residents were often given less than month s notice before their buildings were razed people were displace the common perception was that only pimps and push and prostitutes were from the south bronx and you are told from your earliest days that nothing good going come from your community that bad and ugly how could not reflect you now family s property was worth less save for that was our home and all had and luckily for that home and the love inside along with help from teachers ment and friends along the way was enough now why this story important because from planning perspective economic degradation gets environmental degradation which gets social degradation the investment that began the s set the stage for all the environmental justice that were come anti ated zoning and land use regul ations are still used this day continue putting pollut facilities neighborhood are these factor taken into consider ation when land use policy decided what cost are associated with these decisions and who pay who profit does anything just what the local community goes through this was planning quote that did not have our best interest mind once realized that decided was time our own planning that small park told you about earlier was the first stage building green movement the south bronx wrote one and quarter million dollar federal transportation grant design the plan for water front esplanade with dedicated street bike path physical improvement help form public policy regard traffic safety the place ment the waste and other facilities which done properly don compromise community s quality life they provide opportunities more physically active well local economic development think bike shop juice stand million dollars build first phase projects this lafayette avenue and designed matthews nielsen landscape architects and once this path construct connect the south bronx with more than acre randall s island park right now separate about feet water but this link will change that nurtu the natural environment abundance will give back even more run project called the bronx ecological stewardship training which provide job training the fields ecological rest ations that folks from our community have the skills compete for these well paying jobs little little seed the area with green collar jobs then the people that have both financial and personal take their environment the express under utilize relic the robert moses era built with regard for the neighborhood that were divide even during rush hour goes virtually used the community created alternative transportation plan that allows for the oval the highway have the opportunity now bring together all the holders vision how this acre can better utilize for park land afford able housing and local economic development also built the city s new york city s first green and cool roof demonstration project top our office cool roof are highly reflect surface that don absorb solar heat and pass the building atmosphere green roof are soil and living plants both can used instead petroleum based roof materials that absorb heat contribute urban heat island effect and degrade under the sun which turn breathe green roof also retain percent rain fall they reduce city s need fund cost end pipe solutions which incident ally are often located environmental justice communities like mine and they provide habitat for our little friends cool anyway the demonstration project spring board for our own green roof install ation business bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity the south bronx like that too anyway know chris told not pitch here but since have all your attention need investors end pitch s better ask for ness than permission anyway katrina prior katrina the south bronx and new orleans ninth ward had lot common both were large poor people color both hotbeds cultural innovation think hip hop and jazz both are water front communities that host both industries and residents close proximity one another the post katrina era have still more common best ignored and maligned and abused worst negligent regulatory agencies ious zoning and lax government account ability neither the destruction the ninth ward nor the south bronx was inevitable but have emerged with valuable lesson about how dig ourselves out are more than simply national symbol urban light problems solved empty campaign promise president come and gone now will let the gulf coast languish for decade two like the south bronx did will take active step and learn from the home grown resource grassroots activist that have been born desper ation communities like mine now listen not expect individual corporation government make the world better place because right moral this presentation today only represent some what been through like tiny little bit you clue but tell you later you want know but know s the bottom line one s perception that motivate people the end interested what like call the triple bottom line that sustainable development can produce development that have the potential create positive return for all concerned the developer government and the community where these projects present that s not happening new york city and are operating with comprehensive urban planning deficit parade government subsidies going proposed big box and stadium development the south bronx but there coordination between city agencies how deal with the cumul ative effects increased traffic pollution solid waste and the impact open space and their approach local economic and job development are s not even funny because top that the world s richest sports team replacing the house that ruth built destroying two well loved community parks now have even less than that stat told you about earlier and although less than percent south bronx residents own cars these projects include thousands new parking space yet zip terms mass public trans now what s missing from the larger debate comprehensive cost benefit analysis between not fix healthy environmentally challenge community versus rating structural sustainable changes agency working close with columbia university and others shine light these issues now let s get this straight not anti development our city not wild ness preserve and embrace inner capitalist you probably all have and you haven you need don have problem with developer making money there s enough precede out there show that sustainable community friendly development can still make fortune fellow tedster bill mcdonough and amory lovins both heroes mine the way have shown that you can actually that have problem with development that hyper exploit political vulnerable communities for profit that continue shame upon all because are all responsible for the future that create but one the things mind myself greater possibilities learn from vision aries other cities this version global ization let s take bogota poor latino surround away gun violence and drug traffic king reputation not unlike that the south bronx however this city was blessed the late s with highly influential mayor named enrique penalosa looked the demo graphic few bogatanos own cars yet huge portion the city s resource was dedicated serving them you mayor you can something about that his administration narrow key municipal thoroughfare from five lanes three parking those streets expanded pedestrian walk ways and bike lanes created public plaza created one the most efficient bus mass trans systems the entire world for his brilliant effort was nearly impea ched but people began see that they were being put first issues reflect their day day lives incredible things happened people stopped crime rates dropped because the streets were alive with people his administration attack several typical urban problems one time and third world budget that have excuse this country sorry but the bottom line their people first agenda was not meant those who could actually afford cars but rather provide opportunities for all bogatanos participate the city s resurgence that development should not come the expense the majority the population still considered radical idea here the but bogota s example has the power change that you however are blessed with the gift influence that s why you here and why you value the information exchange use your influence support comprehensive sustainable change everywhere don just talk about ted this nation wide policy agenda trying build and you all know politics are personal help make green the new black help make sustainability sexy make part your dinner and cocktail conversation help fight for environmental and economic justice support investment with triple bottom line return help democrat sustainability bringing everyone the table and insisting that comprehensive planning can address everywhere good glad have little more time listen when spoke gore the other day after break fast asked him how environmental justice activist were going include his new marketing strategy his response was grant program don think understood that wasn asking for funding was making him offer what trouble was that this top down approach still around now don get wrong need money but grassroots groups are needed the table during the decision making process the percent the energy that gore reminded that waste every day don add our energy intelligence and hard earn experience that count have come from far meet you like this please don waste working together can become one those small rapidly growing groups individual who actually have the auda city and courage believe that actually can change the world might have come this conference from very very different station life but believe all share one incredibly powerful thing have nothing lose and everything gain ciao
