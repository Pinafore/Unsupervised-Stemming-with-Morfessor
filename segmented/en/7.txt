getting lot today about frustration people are feeling like things just had alarm come screen luck you can see people are feeling over whelm they feeling like s too much technology too fast may good technology but feel like there s not enough support structure there s not enough help there s not enough thought put into the design make easy and able use one time wrote column about effort reach technical support and with hours there were message from reader the feed board the time website from user saying too and here s tale woe call software rage and man let tell you ever figure out how make money off this frustration will how did that get there just kid why the problem accelerating part the problem iron ally because the industry has put much thought into making things easier use show you what mean this what the computer interface used look like do over the years s gotten easier use this the original mac operating system reagan was president madonna was still brunette and the entire operating system this the good part the entire operating system fit you couldn put the mac the iron that these things became easier use less technical broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time once had the tinct privilege sitting the apple call center for day the guy had licate head for listen and the call that you know how they say your call may record for quality assurance mmm your call may record that they can collect the niest dumb user stories and pass them around which they and have copy s your gift bag with your voice some the stories are just class and yet understand woman called apple complain that her mouse was squeaking making squeaking noise and the technician said well what you mean your mouse squeaking she says all can tell you that squeaks louder the faster move across the screen and the technician s like you got the mouse against the screen she goes well the message said click here continue well you like that one how much time have got another one guy called this absolutely true his computer had crashed and told the technician couldn start matter how many time type and the technician said what why are you ping said the message says error type must admit that some the blame fall square the feet the user but why the technical over crisis the complex crisis accelerating now the hardware world s because the consume want everything smaller smaller smaller the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier but our fingers are essential stay the same size gets more and more challenge software subject another prima force the date release more and more version when you buy piece software s not like buy vase can bar where you own s more like joining club where you pay due every year and every year they say add more features and sell you for know one guy who s spent just photo over the years and software companies make percent their revenue from just these software upgrade call the software upgrade paradox which that you improve piece software enough time you eventually mean microsoft word was last just word process you know the eisenhower administration but what s the alternative microsoft actually did this experiment they said well wait minute everyone complain that add many features let s create word process that s just word process simple pure does not web page not database and came out was called microsoft write and you are acknowledg because die tanked one ever bought call this the port util principle people like surround themselves with necessary power right they don need the database and the website but they like well upgrade because might you know might need that some the problem you add more features where are they going where are you going tick them you only have many design tools you can button you can slide pop menu sub menu but you not care about how you choose you wind with this this touched this not joke touched photo microsoft word the copy that you have with all the tool open you obviously never opened all the tool but all you have type this little teeny window down here and arrive the age interface matrices where there are many features and options you have two dimens you know rtical and horizontal you guys all complain about how microsoft word always bullet your list and under lining your link automatically the off switch there somewhere telling you s there part the art design simple good interface know when use which one these features here the log off dialog box for window there are only four choice why are they pop menu s not like the rest the screen full other components that you need collapse the choice they could have put them all out view here s apple s take the exact same dialog box thank you yes designed the dialog box already can see that apple and microsoft have severe diverg approach software design microsoft s approach simplicity tend let s break down let s just make more step there are these wizard every where and you know there s new version window coming out this fall they continue this pace there s absolutely telling where they might wind welcome the type word wizard bit let s click next continue from the down menu choose the first letter you want type there lim that don want cross what the answer how you pack all these features simple intelligent way believe consistency with possible real world equivalents trash older when possible label things most but beg the designer here break all those rule they violate the biggest rule all which intelligence now what mean that going give you some example where intelligence makes something not consistent but s better you are buy something the web you supposed put your address and you supposed choose which country you from there are countries the world like think the internet global sorry s not one yet s mainly like the united states europe and japan why united states the s you have roll like even screen full get now would consistent put united states first but would intelligent this one s been touched before but why god s name you shut down window click button called start here s another pet one mine you have print most the time you want print one copy your document page order that print why god s name you see this every time you print s like shut cock and one the button the bottom you notice not print now not saying that apple the only company who has embrace the cult simplicity palm also especially the old days wonderful about this actually got speak palm when they were high the s and after the talk met one the employees says nice talk and said thank you what you here said tap counter like you what goes well jeff hawkins the ceo says any task the palm take more than three tap the stylus s too long and has designed the tap counter going show you example company that does not have tap counter this microsoft word when you want create new blank document word could happen you the fil menu and you choose new now what happens when you choose new you get new blank document you not the opposite side the monitor task bar appears and somewhere those link the way not the top somewhere those link button that makes you new document that company not count tap you know don want just stand here and make fun microsoft audience david pogue yes the bill gates song been geek ever and wrote the very first do put software and ibm together got pro and they got the loss write the code that makes the whole world run get royalties from everyone sometimes s garb but the press you buy the box sell the code every software company doing microsoft s amp you can keep good idea down these days even window hack kind based loose the mac s big s you got where not doing this for raise write the code that fits the world today big mediocr every way entered planet ation mode you have choice you buy code bill gates and write the code but actually believe there are really two microsoft there s the old one responsible for window and office they dy throw the whole thing out and start fresh but they can they lock because many add on and other company stuff lock into the old chass but there s also new microsoft that s really doing good simple interface design like the media center like the microsoft spot watch the wire watch flopped miserab the market but wasn because wasn simply and beautiful designed let s put this way would you pay month have watch that has charg every night like your cell phone and stop working when you leave your are code the sign might dicate that the complex crunch only going get worse there any hope the screen are getting smaller people are illuminat putting man the box the things are coming out faster pace s funny when steve job came back apple after years away was the world exp came the stage that black turtleneck and jeans and sort did this the crowd went wild but like where have seen this before had just seen the mov evita with madonna and like you know what got one about steve job won easy you think strange when try explain why back after telling the press apple s future black you won believe all that you see kid his teens who started out garage with only buddy named woz you try rhym with garage don cry for cupertino the truth never left you know the ropes now know what the trick are made tune over pixar don cry for cupertino still got the drive and vision still wear sandals any weather s just that these days they gucci thank you steve job had always believe simplicity and elegance and beauty and the truth for years was little depressed because american obviously did not value because the mac had three percent market share and window had percent market share people did not think was worth putting price was little depressed then heard s talk and realized didn know the meaning depressed but turns out was wrong right because the ipod came out and violate every bit common wisdom other products cost less other products had more features they had voice record and trans mitters the other products were back microsoft with open standard not apple s priety standard but the ipod won this the one they wanted the less was simplicity sell and there are sign that the industry getting the message this little company that s done very well with simplicity and elegance the thing s catch got just couple example physical really cool elegant thinking coming along late when you have digital camera how you get the picture back your computer well you either haul around able you buy card reader and haul that around either one you going lose what take out the memory card and half revealing contact just tick the computer load the picture put right back the camera never have lose anything here s another example chris you the source all power will you power plug chris anderson yeah hold that and don let you might have seen this this apple s new laptop this the power cord hooks like this and sure every one you has done this some point your lives one your children you walk along and about pull this the floor don care s loan here who s magnetic doesn pull the laptop the floor very last example lot work using speech cognition software and you have kind quiet because the software nervous speech cognition software really great for doing email very quickly period like get hundreds them day period and s not just what dictate that write down period also use this feature called voice mac period correct suade not just okay this not deal situation because s getting the echo from the hall and stuff but the point can respond people very quickly saying short word and having write out much longer thing somebody letter say thank for that and converse somebody hate mail which happens daily say piss off that s dirt little secret don tell anyone the point this really interesting story this version eight this software and you know what they put version eight new features s never happened before software the company put new features they just said make the software work right right because for years people had bought this software tried out percent accuracy was all they got which means one words wrong and they put their draw and the company got sick that they said this version not going anything but make sure s darned accurate and that s what they did this cult doing things right starting spread final advice for those you who are consume this technology remember doesn work s not necessarily you could the design the thing you using aware life good design and bad design and you among the people who create the stuff easy hard pre sweat the details for your audience count the tap remember the hard part not deciding what features add s deciding what leave out and best all your motivation simplicity sell bravo thank you very much hear
