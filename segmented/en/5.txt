american designer chris angle explain his philosophy that car design art form own right with entertaining and ultimately moving account the bmw group s deep blue project intended create the suv the future arts business cars design industrial design invention technology transportation chris angle says great cars are art what want talk about background the idea that cars are art this actually quite meaningful because car designers tend little bit low the pole don coffee table books with just one lamp inside and cars are thought much product that s little bit difficult get into the aesthetic side under the same sort term ology that one would discuss art and cars art bring into emotional plane you accept that that you have deal with the same level you would with art with capital now this point you going see picture michelangelo this completely different than automobiles automobiles are self moving things right elevator are automobiles and they not very emotional they solve purpose and certainly automobiles have been around for years and have made our lives functional lot better many ways they also been real pain the because automobiles are really the thing have solve have solve the pollution have solve the congesti but that s not what interest this speech what interest this speech cars automobiles may what you use but cars are what are many ways and long can solve the problems automobiles and believe can with fuel cells hydrogen like bmw really hip and lots other things then think can look past that and try and understand why this hook many this car ness and what that means what can learn from that s what want get cars are not suit clothes cars are avatar cars are expansion yourself they take your thought your ideas your emotions and they multiply your anger whatever s avatar s super that you happen inside and you feel sexy the car sexy and you full road rage you got chevy like rock right cars are sculpture did you know this that every car you see out there sculp hand many people think well s computers and s done machines and stuff like that well they produce but the original are all done hand s done men and women who believe lot their craft and they put that same kind tension into the sculp car that you great sculpture that you would and look museum that tension between the need express the need discover then you put something new into and the same time you have bound craftsmanship rules that say this how you handle surface this what control all about this how you show you master your craft and that tension that discovery that push for something new and the same time that sense obligation the regard craftsmanship that s strong cars anything work clay which hasn changed much since michelangelo started screw around with and there s very interesting analog that too real quickly michelangelo once said s there discover the figure within there the auto mobile that was years right there did you catch that between that one there and that one there changed lot didn s not marketing there s very interesting car concept here but the marketing part not what want talk about here want talk about this why means you have car what that sensuality you have touch about that s the sculpture that goes into that sensuality and s done men and women working just like this making cars now this little quote about sculpture from henry moore believe that that pressure within that moore s talking about least when comes cars comes right back this idea the mean s that will live that need survive express itself that comes car and takes over people like and tell other people this this this until this thing comes alive are completely infected and beauty can the result this infectious ness s quite wonderful this sculpture course the heart all and s really what put the craftsmanship into our cars and s not whole lot different really when they working like this when somebody works like this s that same kind commitment that same kind beauty now now get the point want talk about cars art art the platonic sense truth s beauty and love now this really where designers car business diverge from the engineers don really have problem talking about love don have problem talking about truth beauty that sense that s what search for when working our craft are really trying find that truth out there not trying find and beauty trying find the beauty the truth however engineers tend look things little bit more newtonian instead this quantum approach dealing with rational and dealing with paradox that admit exist and the engineers tend look things little bit more like two and two four and you get s better and even better and that sometimes leads bit divergence why doing what doing pretty much accepted the fact though that are the women the organization bmw bmw very man type business men men men s engineers and kind the female side that that s that s cool you off and man going little bit more female because what interested finding form that s more than just function interested finding beauty that s more than just aesthetic s really truth and think this idea soul being the heart great cars very applicable you all know you know car when you seen with soul you know how strong this well this experience love and the experience design are interchangeable and now coming story discovered something about love and design through project called deep blue and first all you have with for second and say you know you could take the word love out lot things our society put the word design and still works like this quote here you know kind works you know you can understand that works all fair design and war certainly live competitive society think this one here there s pop song that really describe philip star for you know this like you know this like puppy love you know this cool right toothbrush cool really only gets serious when you look something like this this one substitut that believe all design management are guilty and this idea that there more love more design when gets down your neighbor your other can physical like this and maybe the future will but right now s dealing with our own people our own team who are doing the creating story the idea people work what work with here and have make bond with designers when creating bmw have have shared intimacy shared vision that means have work one family have understand ourselves that way there s good times there s interesting times and there s some stress times too you want cars you got outside you got cars the rain you got cars the that s the way presentation made our board director haul their out the too you want know cars outside well you got stand outside this and because these are artists they have very artistic tempera ments all right now one thing about art art discovery and art discovering yourself through your art right and one thing about cars all little bit like pygmali are completely love with our own creation this one favorite painting really describe our relationship with cars this sick beyond belief but because this the intimacy with which work together team takes new dimension new meaning have shared center have shared focus that car stay the middle all our relationship and s job the competitive process narrow this down heard today about joseph s death genes that have and kill cell production you know that s what have sometimes start out with cars narrow down five cars down three cars down two cars down one car and the middle that killing basically someone s love someone s baby this very difficult and you have have bond with your team that permits you this because their life wrap that too they got that gene infected them well and they want that live more than anything else well this project deep blue put contact with team way that never expect and want pass you because want you reflect this perhaps your own relationship wanted car which was complete leap faith for bmw wanted team which was moved from the way done that only had phone number that connected them what did was instead having staff artists that are just your wrist decided free team creative designers and engineers find out what s the success the suv phenomenon america this did this project and sent them off with this team name deep blue now many people know deep blue from ibm actually stole from them because figured anybody read our faxes they think talking about computers turned out was quite clever because deep blue company like bmw has hook deep blue wow cool name people get wrap and took team designers and sent them off america and gave them budget what thought was set deliver able time table and nothing else like said just had phone number that connected them and group engineers worked german and the idea was they would work separate this problem what s the success the suv they would come together compare notes then they would work apart come together and they would produce together monument set diverse opinion that didn pollute each other s ideas but the same time came together and solved the problems hopefully really understand the customer heart where the customer live with them america sent the team off and actually something different happened they went other places they disappeared quite honestly and all got was postcards now got some postcards these guys las vegas and got some postcards these guys the grand canyon and got these postcards niagara fall and pretty soon they new york and don know where else and telling myself this going great car they doing research that never even thought about before right and they decided that instead like having studio and six seven apartment was cheaper rent elizabeth taylor s house malibu and least they told was her house guess was one time she had party there something but anyway this was the house and they all lived there now this living half dozen people who left their some had left their wives behind and families behind and they literally lived this house for the entire six months the project was america but the first three months were the most intensive and one the young women the project she was fantastic lady she actually built her room the bathroom the bathroom was big she built the bed over the bathtub s quite fascinating the other hand didn know anything about this nothing this all going and all getting postcards these guys las vegas whatever saying don worry chris this really going good concept what design studio was probably wasn speed where these guys were however the engineers back munich had taken this kind newtonian solution and they were trying find how many holders can dance the head pin and you know these really serious questions that are front the modern consumer and one was hoping that these two team would get together and this collusi incredible creativity under these incredible surround and these incredibly stress out engineers would create some incredible solutions well what didn know was and what found out was these guys they can even like talk each other under those conditions you get divergence newtonian and quantum thinking that point you have split your dialog that deep and far that they cannot bring this together all and had our first meeting after three months tiburon which just the road from here you know tiburon and the idea was after the first three months this independent research they would present all goschel who now boss and that time was ment the project and they would present their results would see where were going would see the first indic ation what could the success phenomenon the suv america and had these ideas head that this going great mean going see much work s intense know probably las vegas meant lot about and not really sure where the grand canyon came either but somehow all this going come together and going see some really great product went tiburon after three months and the team had gotten together the week before many days ahead time the engineers flew over and designers got together with them and they put their presentation together well turns out that the engineers hadn done anything and they hadn done anything because kind like car business engineers are there solve problems and were asking them create problem and the engineers were waiting for the designers say this the problem that created now help solve and they couldn talk about what happened was the engineers showed with nothing and the engineers told the designers you with all your stuff walk out walk right out the project didn know any this and got presentation that had agenda looked like this there was whole lot dialog spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs built between engineers and designers and here expecting any moment they going turn the page and going see the cars going see the sketch going see maybe some idea where s going dialog kept going with mental map words and pretty soon was becoming obvious that instead being dazzl with brilliance was seriously being baffle with bullshit and you can imagine what this like have these months post card indic ation how great this team working and they out there spend all this money and they learning and they doing all this stuff went fuck ball istic right went nuts you can probably remember tiburon used look like this after four hours this stood and took this team apart cream them yell them what the hell are you doing you letting down you designers you supposed the creative ones what the hell going around here was probably one better tirades have some good ones but this was probably one better ones and went into these people how could they take bmw s money how could they have holiday for three months and produce nothing nothing because course they didn tell that they had three station wagon full drawing model concept pictures everything wanted they locked the cars because they had shown solid with the engineers and they decided not show anything order give the chance for problem solving chance start because they hadn realized course that they couldn problem creating went lunch and got tell you this was one seriously quiet lunch the engineers all one end the table the designers and the other end the table really quiet and was just fuck furious furious probably because they had all the fun and didn you know that s what you get furious about right and somebody asked about catherine wife you know did she fly out with something said and trigger set thought about wife and called that when catherine and were married the priest gave very nice serm and said something very important said love not selfish said love does not mean count how many times say love you doesn mean you had sex this many times this month and s two times less than last month that means you don love much love not selfish and thought about this and thought you know not showing love here seriously not showing love the air the air without trust this cannot this cannot that expecting certain number sketch and that s quant ation method for qualify team this cannot told them this story said guys thinking about something here this isn right can have relationship with you guys based premise that quant able one based dictate premise that says boss you what say without trust said this can actually all broke down into tear quite honest about because they still could not tell how much frustration they had built inside them not being able show what wanted and merely having ask trust them that would come and think felt much closer that day cut lot string that didn need there and the concept for what real team and creativity all about put the car back the center our thought and put love think truly back into the center the process the way that team went create six different concept for the next model what would the proposal for the next generation after suv america one those was the idea crossover coupe you see downstairs the coupe they had lot fun with that was the renditi our motorcycle the carl magn says the idea what could motorcycle you add two more wheels and conclusion lesson that wanted pass you was this one here also going steal little quote out little prince there s lot said about trust and love you know that those two words are synonymous for design had very very meaningful relationship with team that day and s stayed that way ever since and hope that you too find that there s more design and more towards the art the design than doing yourself s true that the trust and the love that makes worth while thanks much
