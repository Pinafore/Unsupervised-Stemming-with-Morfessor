jane good has found the miss link but she s come closer than near anyone else the prima logist says the only real difference between humans and chimps our sophisticated language she urges start using change the world africa featured animals culture environment global issues nature prima science jane good what separate from the apes good morning everyone first all s been fantastic being here over these past few days and second feel s great honor kind wind this extraordinary gather people these amazing talk that had feel that fit many way some the things that heard came direct here from the deep deep tropical rain forest ecuador where was out you could only get there plane with digenous people with paint their faces and parrot feathers their address where these people are fighting try and keep the oil companies and keep the road out their forest they fighting develop their own way living with the forest world that s clean world that isn contaminated world that isn polluted and what was amazing and what fits right with what all talking about here ted that there right the middle this rain forest was some solar panel the first that part ecuador and that was mainly bring water pump that the women would have down the water was clean but because they got lot batteries they were able lot electricity every house and there were think eight house this little community could have light for think was about half hour each even and there the chief all his regal fine with laptop computer and this man has been side but s gone back and was saying you know have suddenly jump into whole new and didn even know about the white man years ago and now here are with laptop computer and there are some things want learn from the modern world want know about health care want know about what other people interested and want learn other language want know english and french and perhaps chinese and good language there with his little laptop computer but fighting against the might the pressure because the debt the foreign debt ecuador fighting the pressure world bank imf and course the people who want explo the forest and take out the oil and coming direct from there here but course real field expert lies even different kind civil ization can really call civil ization different way life different being talked earlier this wonderful talk wade dav about the different culture the humans around the world but the world not compos only human being there are also other animal being and propose bring into this ted conference always around the world the voice the animal kingdom too often just see few slide bit film but these being have voice that mean something and want give you greet from chimpanzee the forest tanzania ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh been studying chimpanzees tanzania since during that time there have been modern technologies that have really trans the way that field logist their work for example for the first time few years ago simply collect little fecal sample were able have them analyze have dna pro done for the first time actually know which male chimps are the father each individual fant because the chimps have very miscuous mating society this open whole new avenue research and use gsi ographic what gsi deter the range the chimps and using you can see that not really into this kind stuff but using satellite image look the deforestation the are and course there s develop ment infrared you can watch animals night and equipment for record video and tap record getting light and better many many way can things today that couldn when began especially when chimpanzees and other animals with large brain are studied captivity modern technology help search for the upper level cognition some these non human animals that know today they capable performance that would have been thought absolutely possible science when began think the chimpanzee captivity who the most intellectual performance one called japan her name means love and she has wonderful sensitive partner working with her she love her computer she leave her big group and her running water and her tree and everything and she come this computer s like video game for kid she s hooked she s the way and she does things with her computer screen and touch pad that she can faster than most humans she does very complex task and haven got time into them but the amazing thing about this female she doesn like making mistakes she has bad run and her score isn good she come and reach and tap the glass because she can see the experiment which ask have another and her concentration she s already concentrated hard for minutes and now she want all over again just for the satisf action having done better and the food not important she does get tiny reward like one for correct response but she will for nothing you tell her before here are chimpanzee using computer chimpanzees gorillas orangutans also learn human sign language but the point that when was first gombe remember well vivid though was yesterday the first time when was going through the ation the chimpanzees were still running away from for the most part although some were little bit acclimatized and saw this dark shape hunched over termite moun and peered with binoculars was tunate one adult male who named david greybeard and the way science that time was telling that shouldn name the chimps they should all have number that was more scientific anyway david greybeard and saw that was pick little piece grass and using them fish termite from their under ground and not only that would sometimes pick leaf twig and trip the leave modify object make suit for specific purpose the beginning tool making the reason this was exciting and such break through that time was thought that humans and only humans used and made tools when was school were define man the tool that when lou leak ment heard this new said must now define man define tool accept chimpanzees humans now know that gombe alone there are nine different way which chimpanzees use different object for different purpose more know that different parts africa where chimps have been studied there are completely different tool using behavior and because seems that these pattern are passed from one generation the next through observ ation ation and practice that definition human culture what find that over these odd years that and other have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes and say other mammals with complex brain and social systems have found that after all there isn shar line dividing humans from the rest the animal kingdom s very wuzzy line s getting wuzzier all the time find animals doing things that our arrogance used think was just human the chimps there s time discuss their fascinating lives but they have this long childhood five years suckl and sleeping with the mother and then another three four five years emotion depend her even when the next child born the importance learning that time when behavior flexible and there s lot learn chimpanzee society the long term affect support bonds that develop through this long childhood with the mother with the other and sister and which can last through life which may years they can actually live longer than captivity only done years the wild far and find chimps are capable true passion and altruism find their non verbal communication this very rich they have lot sounds which they use different circums tances but they also use touch post gesture and what they they kiss they embrace they hold hands they one another the back they swagger they shake their the kind things that and they them the same kind context they have very sophisticated cooperation sometimes they hunt not that often but when they hunt they show sophisticated cooperation and they share the pre find that they show emotion similar maybe sometimes the same those that descri ourselves happiness ness fear despair they know ment well physical suffer and don have time into the information that will pro some these things you save say that there are very right student the best univers ities studying emotion animals studying personal ities animals know that chimpanzees and some other creature can recogn themselves mirrors self opposed other they have sense humor and these are the kind things which traditional have been thought human prerogatives but this teach new respect and s new respect not only for the chimpanzees suggest but some the other amazing animals with who share this planet once prepar admit that after all not the only being with personal ities mind and above all feeling and then start think about way use and abuse many other sent sapient creature this planet really give cause for deep shame least for the sad thing that these chimpanzees who perhaps taught more than any other creature little humil are the wild disappear very fast they disappear for the reason that all you this room know only too well the deforestation the growth human population need more land they disappear because some timber companies with clear cut they disappear the heart their range africa because the big multi national logging companies have come and made road they want ecuador and other parts where the forest remain touched take out oil timber and this has led con basin and other parts the world what know the bush trade this means that although for hundreds perhaps thousands years people have lived those forest what habitat harmony with their world just kill the animals they need for themselves and their families now suddenly because the road the hunt can from the towns they shoot everything every single thing that move that s big than small they sun dry smoke and now they got trans they take the logging truck the mining truck into the towns where they sell and people will pay more for bush s called than for domestic s cultural preferred and s not sustainable and the huge logging camp the forest are now dem the pyg hunt the con basin who lived there with their wonderful way living for many hundreds years are now corrupted they give they shoot for the logging camp they get money their culture being destroy along with the animals who they depend when the logging camp move there s nothing left talked already about the loss human cultural diversity and seen happening with own eyes and the grim picture africa love africa and what see africa see deforestation see the desert spread see mass hunger see disease and see population growth are where there are more people living certain piece land than the land can possibly support and they too poor buy food from else where were the people that heard about yesterday the east land who cut down their last tree were they stupid didn they know what was happening course but you seen the crippl poverty some these parts the world isn question let s leave the tree for tomorrow how going feed family today maybe can get just few dollars from this last tree which will keep going little bit longer and then pray that something will happen save from the table end this pretty grim picture the one thing have which makes different from chimpanzees other living creature this sophisticated spoke language language with which can tell children about things that aren here can talk about the distant past plan for the distant future discuss ideas with each other that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom group can talking each other can through video can through the written word and are this great power have wise wards and destroy the world the develop world way s worse because have much access know ledge the stupid what doing you know bring little babies into world where many place the water poison them and the air harming them and the food that s grow from the contaminated land poison them and that s not just the far away develop world that s every where you know all have about chemical our bodies didn have about years ago and many these disease like asthma and certain kinds cancer are the increase around place where our filthy toxic waste dumped harming ourselves around the world well harming the animals well harming nature self mother nature that brought into being mother nature where believe need spend time where there s tree and and birds for our good psycho logical develop and yet there are hundreds and hundreds children the develop world who never see nature because they grow concrete and all they know virtual real with opportunity and lie the sun the forest with the dappled sun spec coming down from the can above was travel around the world you know had leave the forest that s where love had leave these fascinating chimpanzees for student and field staff continue studying because finding they dwindled from about two million years ago about now knew had leave the forest what could raise aware around the world and the more talked about the chimpanzees light the more realized the fact that everything s inter connected and the problems the develop world often stem from the greed the develop world and everything was joining together and making not sense hope lies sense you said s making sense how can somebody said that yesterday and was travel around kept meeting young people who lost hope they were feeling despair they were feeling well doesn matter what eat drink and merry for tomorrow die everything hope always being told the media and then met some who were angry and that can turn violence and all familiar with that and have three little grand children and when some these student would say high school university they say angry fill with despair because feel you promise our future and there s nothing can about and looked the eyes little grand children and think how much harmed this planet since was their age feel this deep shame and that s why tanzania started program that s called roots and shoots there s little brochure all around side and any you have anything with children and care about their future beg that you pick that brochure and roots and shoots program for hope roots make firm foundation shoots seem tiny but reach the sun they can break through rick walls see the rick walls all the problems that flicted this planet then you see message hope hundreds and thousands young people around the world can break through and can make this better world and the most important message roots and shoots that every single individual makes difference every individual has role play every one impact the world around every and you scientist know that you can actually even you stay bed all day you breathing oxygen and giving out and probably going the loo and things like that you making difference the world the roots and shoots program volves you three kinds project and these are project make the world around them better place one project show care and concern for your own human community one for animals including domestic animals and have say learn everything know about animal behavior even before got gombe and the chimps from dog rusty who was childhood companion and the third kind project something for the local environment what the kids depend first all how old are they and now from pre school right through university s going depend whether they city rural s going depend they althy impoverished s going depend which part say america they every state now and the problems florida are different from the problems new york s going depend which country they and already plus countries with about active group and there are group all over the place that keep hear about that never even heard because the kids are taking the program and spread themselves why because they buy into and they the one who get decide what they going isn something that their parents tell them their teach tell them that s effect but they decide themselves want clean this river and put the fish back that used there want clear away the toxic from this are and have organ garden want and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their stories want and work dog she want learn about animals want you know goes and and this very hope for travel around the world days year every where there s group roots and shoots different age every where there are children with eyes saying look the difference made and now comes the technology into because with this new way municat electronic these kids can communicate with each other around the world and anyone interested help got many ideas but need help need help create the right kind system that will help these young people communicate their excite but also and this important communicate their despair say tried this and doesn work and what hall and then and hold there s another group answer these kids who may america maybe this group rael saying yeah you did little bit wrong this how you should the philosophy very simple not believe violence violence bombs guns that s not the way solve problems violence lead violence least view how solve the tools for the problems are know ledge and understand know the fact but see how they fit the big picture hard work and persist don give and love and passion lead respect for all life how many more minutes two one chris anderson one one two jane good two two going take two are you going come and drag off anyway basically roots and shoots beginning change young people s lives s what devot most energy and believe that group like this can have very major impact not just because you can share technology with but because many you have children and you take this program out and give your children they have such good opportunity out and good because they got parents like you and s been clear how much you all care about trying make this world better place s very encouraging but the kids ask and this won take more than two minutes promise the kids say jane you really have hope for the future you travel you see all these horrible things happening first the human brain don need say anything about that now that know what the problems are around the world human brain like your are solve those problems and talked lot about that second the resili nature can destroy river and can bring back life can see whole are desolated and can brought back bloom again with time little help and third the last speak talked about the speak before last talked about the able human spir are surround the most amazing people who things that seem absolutely possible nels man take little piece lim from robben land where lab for years and came out with little bit ness could lead his people from the horror without blood even after the september and was new york and felt the fear nevertheless there was much human rage much love and much passion and then went around the country after that and felt the fear the fear that was lead people feeling they couldn worry about the environment any more case they seemed not patr iotic and was trying encourage them somebody came with little quot ation from mahatma gandhi you look back through human history you see that every evil regime has been over good and just after that woman brought this little and want end this not she said you talking about hope and pea ring this this made from metal from used land from the kill field pol pot one the most evil regime human history where people are now beginning put their lives back together after the regime has crumbled yes there hope and where the hope out there with the politic s our hands s your hands
