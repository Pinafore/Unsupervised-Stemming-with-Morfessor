tony robbins discuss the invisible forces that motivate everyone s action and high five gore the front row business culture entertainment politics potential psychology tony robbins asks why what thank you have tell you both challenge and excited excite ment get chance give something back challenge the short seminar usually hours not exagge rating weekends and what even more than that obviously coach people but into immersion because how did you learn language you didn learn just learning principles you got and you did often that became real and the bottom line why here besides being crazy mofo that really position not here motivate you obviously you don need that and lot times that s what people think and s the furthest thing from what happens though people say don need any motivation and say well that s interesting that s not what the why guy want know why you what you what your motive for action what that drive you your life today not years ago are you running the same pattern because believe that the invisible force internal drive activ ated the most important thing the world here because believe emotion the force life all here have great minds you know most here have great minds right don know about another category but all know how think and with our minds can rational anything can make anything happen can agree with what was described few days ago about this idea that people work their self interest but all know that that s bullshit times you don work your self interest all the time because when emotion comes into the ring changes the way function and s wonderful for think intellectual about how the life the world and especially those who are very smart can play this game our head but really want know what s driving you and what would like maybe invite you the end this talk explore where you are today for two reasons one that you can contribute more and two that hopefully can not just understand other people more but maybe appreciate them more and create the kinds connection that can stop some the challenge that face our society today they only going get magn ified the very technology that s connecting because s making intersect and that inter section doesn always create the view everybody now understand everybody and everybody appreciate everybody had obsession basically for years and that obsession has been what makes the difference the quality people lives what makes the difference their performance because that s what got hired got produce the result now that s what done for years get the phone call when the athlete burning down national television and they were ahead five stroke and now they can get back the course and got something right now get the result nothing matter get the phone call when the child going commit suicide and got something right now and years very grateful tell you never lost one years doesn mean won some day but haven done and the reason understanding these human needs that want talk you about when get those call about performance that s one thing how you make change but also looking see what that s shaping that person s ability contribute something beyond themselves maybe the real question you know look life and say there s two master lesson one there s the science achieve ment which almost everything that s run master amazing extent that s how you take the invisible and make visible right how you take what you dreaming and make happen whether your business your contribution society money whatever for you your body your family but the other lesson life that rarely master the art fulfill ment because science easy right know the rules you write the code you follow the and you get the results once you know the game you just you know you the don you but when comes fulfill ment that s art and the reason s about appreciation and s about contribution you can only feel much yourself had interesting laboratory try answer the question the real question which what s the difference somebody s life you look somebody like those people that you given everything like all the resource they say they need you gave them not dollar computer you gave them the best computer you gave them love you gave them joy you were there comfort them and those people very often and you know some them sure end the rest their life with all this love education money and background spend their life going and out rehab and then you meet people that have been through ultimate pain psychological sexually spiritual emotionally abused and not always but often they become some the people that contribute the most society the question got ask ourselves really what what that shapes and live therapy culture most don that but the culture s therapy culture and what mean that the mind that are our past and everybody this room you wouldn this room you bought that theory but the most society think ography destiny the past equal the future and course does you live there but what people this room know and what have mind ourselves though because you can know something intellectual you can know what and then not use not apply really going mind ourselves that decision the ultimate power that s what really now when you ask people you know have you failed achieve something how many have ever failed achieve something significant your life say aye audience aye thanks for the interaction high level there but you ask people why didn you achieve something somebody who s working for you you know partner even yourself when you fail achieve goal what s the reason people say they fail achieve what they tell you don have the didn know enough didn have the knowledge didn have the money didn have the time didn have the technology you know didn have the right manager didn have the gore supreme court and and what all those including the supreme court have common they are claim you missing resource and they may accurate you may not have the money you may not have the supreme court but that not the defining factor and you correct wrong the defining factor never resource s resource fulness and what mean specifically rather than just some phrase you have emotion human emotion something that experience from you day before yesterday level that profound ever experience and you communicate with that emotion believe you would have beat his and won but how easy for tell him what should idiot robbins but know when watched the debate that time there were emotions that block people s ability get this man s lect and capacity and the way that came across some people that day because know people that wanted vote your direction and didn and was upset but there was emotion that was there how many know what talking about here say aye audience aye emotion and get the right emotion can get ourselves anything can get through you creative enough play enough fun enough can you get through anybody yes audience yes you don have the money but you creative and determine enough you find the way this the ultimate resource but this not the story that people tell right the story people tell bunch different stories they tell don have the resource but ultimately you take look here flip you would they say what are all the reasons they haven accomplish that next one please s broken pattern that itch but appreciate the energy tell you that what determines your resource said decisions shape destiny which focus here decisions shape destiny what determines three decisions what are you going focus right now you have decide what you going focus this second conscious conscious the minute you decide focus something you got give meaning and whatever that meaning produce emotion this the end the beginning god punish reward this the roll the dice emotion then create what going the action think about your own life the decisions that have shaped your destiny and that sounds really heavy but the last five years years how have there been some decisions you made that you made different decision your life would completely different how many can think about honestly better worse say aye audience aye the bottom line maybe was where work and you met the love your life there maybe was career decision know the google geniuses saw here mean understand that their decision was sell their technology first what they made that decision versus build their own culture how would the world different how would their lives different their impact the history our world these decisions when woman stand and says won the back the bus she didn just affect her life that decision shaped our culture someone standing front tank being position like lance armstrong and someone says you you got test ular cancer that s pretty tough for any male especially you ride bike you got your brain you got your lung but what was his decision what focus different than most people what did mean wasn the end was the beginning what going goes off and win seven champion ship never once won before the cancer because got emotional fitness psychological strength that s the difference human beings that seen the three million that been around because that s about lab had three million people from different countries that had chance interact with over the last years and after while patterns become obvious you see that south america and africa may connected certain way right other people say that sounds ridiculous s simple what shaped lance what shapes you two invisible forces very quickly one state all have had time you had time you did something and after you did you thought yourself can believe said that can believe did that that was stupid who s been there say aye audience aye have you ever done something after you did you that was right wasn your ability was your state your model the world what shapes you long term your model the world the filter that s what s shaping that s what makes people make decisions when want influence somebody got know what already influence them and s made three parts believe first what s your target what are you after which believe s not your desire you can get your desire goal how many have ever got goal desire and thought this all there how many have been there say aye audience aye s needs have believe there are six human needs second once you know what the target that s driving you and you cover for the truth you don form you cover then you find out what s your map what s the belief systems that are telling you how get those needs some people think the way get those needs destroy the world some people build something create something love someone and then there s the fuel you pick very quickly six needs let tell you what they are first one certainty now these are not goal desire these are universal everyone needs
