atheism comedy culture performance religion storytelling theater julia sweeney letting god september the morning seven birthday came downstairs the kitchen where mother was washing the dish and father was reading the paper something and sort presented myself them the door and they said hey happy birthday and said seven and father smile and said well you know what that means don you and said yeah that going have party and cake and get lot present and dad said well yes but more important being seven means that you reached the age reason and you now capable committing any and all against god and man now had heard this phrase age reason before sister mary kevin had been dying about second grade class school but when she said the phrase seemed all caught the excite ment ations for our first comm union and our first confession and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white and anyway hadn really paid all that much attention that phrase age reason said yeah yeah age reason what does that mean again and dad said well believe the catholic church that god know that little kids don know the difference between right and wrong but when you seven you old enough know better you grown and reached the age reason and now god will start keeping notes you and begin your permanent record and said wait minute you mean all that time till today all that time was good god didn notice and mom said well noticed and thought how could not have known this before how could not have sunk when they been telling all that being good and real credit for and worst all how could not have realized this very important information until the very day that was basically less said well mom and dad what about santa claus mean santa claus know you naught nice right and dad said yeah but honey think that s technically just between thanks giving and christmas and mother said bob stop let s just tell her mean she s seven julie there santa claus now this was actually not that setting parents had this whole elaborate story about santa claus how they had talked santa claus himself and agreed that instead santa deliver our present over the night christmas eve like did for every other family who got open their surprise first thing christmas morning our family would give santa more time santa would come our house while were nine clock high mass christmas morning but only all kids did not make fuss which made very suspicious was pretty obvious that was really our parents giving the present mean dad had very distinct wrap ping style and mother s hand writing was close santa s plus why would santa save time having loop back our house after gone everybody else s there s only one obvious conclusion reach from this mountain evidence our family was too strange and weird for even santa claus come visit and poor parents were trying protect from the embarrass ment this humili ation rejection santa who was jolly but let s face was also very judgment find out that there was santa claus all was actually sort relief left the kitchen not really shock about santa but rather was just dumb founded about how could have missed this whole age reason thing was too late for but maybe could help someone else someone who could use the information they had fit two criteria they had old enough able understand the whole concept the age reason and not yet seven the answer was clear brother bill was six well finally found bill about block away from our house this public school play ground was saturday and was all himself just kick ball against the side wall ran him and said bill just realized that the age reason starts when you turn seven and then you capable committing any and all against god and man and bill said and then said you six you have whole year anything you want and god won notice and said and said everything and turned run was angry with him but when got the top the step turned around dramatically and said the way bill there santa claus now didn know

over the place started tell you your birthday was september but julie you were ready start school honey you were ready thought about and when was four was already the four children and mother even had another child come what think she understand ably really meant was that she was ready she was ready then she said don worry julie every year october when was your birthday but you didn realize made sure that you ate piece cake that day which was comfort but troubling mother had been celeb rating birthday with without what was setting about this new piece information was not that was going have change the date slumber party with all girl friends what was most setting was that this meant that was not virgo had huge virgo poster bedroom and read horoscope every single day and was totally and this meant that was libra took the bus downtown get the new libra poster the virgo poster picture beautiful woman with long hair sort loung some water but the libra poster just huge scale this was around the time that started fill out physically and was fill out lot more than lot the other girls and frankly the whole idea that logical sign was scale just seemed ominous and press but got the new libra poster and started read new libra horoscope and was astonished find that was also totally wasn until years later looking back this whole age reason change birthday thing that dawn wasn turning seven when thought turned seven had whole other month anything wanted before god started keeping tab life can cruel one day two mormon mission aries came door now just live off main thoroughfare los angeles and block well s natural beginning for people who are peddl things door door sometimes get little old ladies from the seven day adventist church showing these cartoon pictures heaven and sometimes get teenager who promise that they won join gang and just start bing people only buy some magazine subscription from them normally just ignore the door but this day answer and there stood two boys each about white star ched short sleeve shirt and they had little name tag that identified them official represent ative the church jesus chris latter day saint and they said they had message for from god said message for from god and they said yes now was raised the pacific north west around lot church latter day saint people and you know worked with them and even dated them but never really knew the doctrine what they said people when they were out mission and guess was sort curious said well please come and they looked really happy because don think this happens them all that often and them down and got them glasses water got got them glasses water don touch hair that s the thing you can put video myself front and expect not fix hair them down and got them glasses water and after nice ties they said you believe that god love you with all his heart and thought well course believe god but you know don like that word heart because anthrop omorphizes god and don like the word his either because that sexual god but didn want argue semantic with these boys after very long comfortable pause said yes yes feel very loved and they looked each other and smile like that was the right answer and then they said you believe that all brother and sister this planet and said yes yes and was relieved that was question could answer quickly and they said well then have story tell you and they told this story all about this guy named lehi who lived jerusalem now apparently jerusalem everyone was completely bad and evil every single one them man woman child infant fetus and god came lehi and said him put your family boat and will lead you out here and god did lead them led them america said america from jerusalem america boat and they said yes then they told how lehi and his desc ants produced and produced and over the course years there were two great race them the nephites and the lamanites and the nephites were totally totally good each and every one them and the lamanites were totally bad and evil every single one them just bad the bone then after jesus died the cross for our his way heaven stopped america and visited the nephites and told them that they all remain totally totally good each and every one them they would win the war against the evil lamanites but apparently somebody blew because the lamanites were able kill all the nephites all but one guy this guy named mormon who managed survive hid the wood and made sure this whole story was written down formed egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled gold plate which then buried near palm new york well was just the edge seat said what happened the lamanites and they said well they became our native americans here the s and said you believe the native americans are desc ended from people who were totally evil and they said yes then they told how this guy named joseph smith found those buried gold plate right his back yard and also found this magic stone back there that put into his hat and then buried his face into and this allowed him translate the gold plate from the formed egyptian into english well this point just wanted give these two boys some advice about their pitch wanted say don start with this story mean even the scient ologists know start with personal test before they start telling people all about xenu the evil intergalactic over lord well then they said you believe that god speak through his righteous prophets and said don because was sort upset about this lama nite story and this crazy gold plate story but the truth was hadn really thought this through back pedaled little and said well what exactly you mean righteous and what you mean prophets like could the prophets women and they said and said why and they said well s because god gave women gift that spectacular wonderful that the only gift had left over give men was the gift prophecy what this wonderful gift god gave women wonder maybe their greater ability operate and adapt women s longer lifespan the fact that women tend much less violent than men but wasn any these gift they said well s her ability bear children said come mean even women tried have baby every single year from the time they were the time they were they didn die from exhaust still seems like some women would have some time left over hear the word god and they said well then they didn look fresh faced and cute any more but they had more say they said well also believe that you mormon and you good standing with the church when you die you get heaven and with your family for all etern and said dear that wouldn such good incentive for and they said hey well also believe that when you heaven you get your body store you best original state like you lost leg well you get back you gone blind you could see said now don have uterus because had cancer few years ago does this mean that went heaven would get old uterus back and they said sure and said don want back happy without gosh what you had nose job and you liked would god force you get your old nose back well then they gave this book mormon and they told read this chapter and that chapter and they said they come back some day and check and think said something like please don hurry maybe was just please don and they were gone initial felt really superior these boys and smug more conventional faith but then the more thought about the more had honest with myself someone came door and was hearing catholic ology and for the very first time and they said believe that god impregnated very young girl without the use inter course and the fact that she was virgin ally important and she had baby and that s the god mean would think that s equally ridiculous just used that story couldn let myself feel ending towards these boys but the question they asked when they first arrived really stuck head did believe that god loved with all his heart because wasn exactly sure how felt about that question now they asked you feel that god love you with all his heart well that would have been much different think would have instantly answer yes yes feel all the time feel god s love when hurt and confused and feel consoled and cared for take shelter god s love when don understand why tragedy hits and feel god s love when look with gratitude all the beauty see but since they asked that question with the word believe somehow was all different because wasn exactly sure believed what clearly felt
