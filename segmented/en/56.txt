accepting his ted prize photographer ed ward burtynsky makes wish that his images stunning landscape that document humanity s impact the world help persuade millions join global conversation sustainability ted prize art arts culture design environment photography pollution social change ed ward burtynsky manufacture landscape walk around for four months with three wishes and all the ideas will start late think everybody should think that you got three wishes and what would you s actually great exercise really drill down the things that you feel are important and really reflect the world around and thinking that can individual actually something come with something that may actually get some action out there and make difference inspired nature that s the here and think quite frankly that s where started became very interested the landscape canadian have this great north and there was pretty small population and father was avid outdoors really had chance experience that and could never really understand exactly what was how was form but what think was telling that are this trans ient thing that s happening and that the nature that you see out there the touched shore lines the touched forest that was able see really bring sense that logical time that this has gone for long time and experiencing different way and that was reference point that think needed have able make the work that did and did out and did this picture grass coming through the spring along road side this birth grass and then went out for years trying photograph the pristine landscape but fine art photographer somehow felt that wouldn catch out there that there would problem with trying make this fine art career and kept being suck into this the calendar picture something that nature and couldn get away from started think how can think the landscape decided think the landscape the landscape that transform had bit epiphany being lost pennsylvania and took left turn trying get back the highway and ended town called frack ville got out the car and stood and was coal mining town did turn around and that became one the most real landscape ever seen totally transform man and that got out and look mine like this and out and look the largest industrial ions the landscape that could find and that became the baseline what was doing and also became the that felt that could hold and not have invent myself that this was large enough become life s work become something that could sink teeth into and just research and find out where these industries are and think one the things also wanted say thanks which kind missed was thank all the corporation who helped get because took negoti ation for almost every one these photograph get into that place make those photograph and wasn for those people letting the head those corporation would have never made this body work that respect not against the corporation own corporation work with them and feel that all need them and they important but also for sustainability there s this thing that pull both direction and not making indic ment towards what s happening here but slow progression started thinking well live all these ages man the stone age and the iron age and the copper age and these ages man are still work today but become totally connected from them there s something that not seeing there and s scary thing well because when start looking the collect appetite for our lifestyle and what doing that landscape that something that very sobering moment for contemplat and through photograph hoping able engage the audience work and come and not immediately ject the image not say god what but challenge say wow this beautiful one level but the other level this scary shouldn enjoy like forbidden pleasure and s that forbidden pleasure that think what resonate out there and gets people look these things and gets people enter and also way define kind what feel too that drawn have good life want house and want car but there s this consequence out there and how begin have that action repulsi s even own science having and here work trying build that same ggle these things that photograph this tire pile here had million tires was the largest one was only about hour and half away from and caught fire about four years ago s around west california around modes and decided start looking something that had the earlier work looking the landscape had sense ment what were doing nature the recycling work that you seeing here was starting point direction was our empti that the recycling work that was doing looking for practice human activity that sustainable that keep putting things through industrial and urban existence back into the system keep doing that can continue course listening the conference there s many many things that are coming bio mimicry and there s many other things that are coming stream nano technology that may also prevent from having into that landscape and tear apart and all look forward those things but the mean time these things are scaling these things are continuing happen what you looking here went bangladesh started move away from north america started look our world global these images bangladesh came out radio program was listening they were talking about exxon valdez and that there was going glut oil tankers because the insurance industries and that those oil tankers needed decommissioned and was going the pinnacle and thought god wouldn that something see the largest vessels man being construct hand literally third world countries originally was going india and was shut out india because green peace situation there and then was able get into bangladesh and saw for the first time third world view that had never actually thought was possible million people living area the size wiscons people everywhere the pollution was intense and the working conditions were horrible here you looking some oil fields california some the biggest oil fields and again started think that there was another epiphany that the whole world was living was result having plentiful oil and that was again something that started building and continued build this series hoping have ready about two three years under the head the oil party because think everything that involved our clothing our cars our road and everything are directly result going move some pictures china and for china started photograph four years ago and china truly question sustainability mind not mention that china well has great effect the industries that grew around came out blue collar town town and father worked was very familiar with that kind industry and that also informed work but you know see china and the scale which s evolving quite something what you see here the three gorges dam and this the largest dam percent ever attempt man most the engineers around the world left the project because they said s just too big fact when did actually fill with water year and half ago they were able measure wobble within the earth was spinning took fifteen days fill this created reservoir kilometers long one the largest reservoir ever created and what was also one the bigger projects around that was moving full size cities out the reservoir and flatten all the buildings they could make way for the ship this before and after that was before and this like weeks later demo lished hand think the buildings they used dynamite everything else was hand that was weeks later and this gives you idea and was all the people who lived those home were the ones that were actually taking apart and working and getting paid per brick take their cities apart and these are some the images from that spent about three trips the three gorges dam looking that massive transformation landscape and looks like bomb out landscape but isn what s landscape that intentional one this need for power and they willing through this massive transformation this scale get that power and again s actually relief for what s going china because think the table right now there s nuclear power station built there hasn been one built north america for years because the problem not back yard but china they saying putting the next years and coal burning furnaces are going there for electric power literally week coal itself probably one the largest problems and one the other things that happened the three gorges lot the agricultural land that you see there the left was also lost some the most fertile agricultural land was lost that and million people were located depending whose statistics you looking and this what they were building this wushan one the largest cities that was located this the town hall for the city and again the rebuild the city was sad see that they didn really grab lot guess what know here terms urban planning there were parks there were green space very high density living the side hill and here they had chance rebuild cities from the bottom but somehow were not connecting with them here sign that translate says obey the birth control law build our science civil ized and advanced idea marriage and giving birth here you look this poster has all the trappings western culture you seeing the tuxedo the bouquets but what s really frightening about the picture and about this bill board the the background s like marry all the things that have and s adaptation our way life full stop and again when you start seeing that kind embrace and you start looking them leading their rural lifestyle with very very small footprint and moving into urban lifestyle with much higher footprint starts become very sobering this shot one the biggest square guangdong and this where lot grant workers are coming from the country and there s about million people migration trying get into urban center all times and the next years are expecting another million people migrate into the urban center like shanghai and the manufacturing center the manufacturers are the domestic are usually you can tell domestic factory the fact that they all use the same color uniform this pink uniform this factory s shoe factory and they have dorm for the workers they bring them from the country and put them the dorm this one the biggest shoe factories the yuan shoe factory near shenzhen has employee making shoes this shift change one three there s two factories this scale the same town this one with every lunch there s about coming through for lunch they down they have about minutes the next round comes s incredible work force that s building there shanghai looking the urban renewal shanghai and this whole area that will flatten and turned into skyscraper the next five years what s also happening shanghai china changing because this wouldn have happened five years ago for instance this hold they called dengzahoos they like pin tacks the ground they won move they not negoti ating they not getting enough they not going move and they holding off until they get deal with them and they been actually quite successful getting better deal because most them are getting raw deal they being put out about two hours the communities that have been around for literally hundreds years maybe even thousands years are being broken and spread across the suburban areas outside shanghai but these are whole series guys holding out this construction shanghai probably the largest urban renewal project think ever attempt the planet and then the embrace the things that they replacing with again one wishes and never ended going there was somehow tell them that there were better ways build house the kinds collision style and things were quite something and these are called the villas and also like right now they just moving the scaffolding still and this waste area and you looked the fore ground the big print you see that the industry their industry they all recycling the industry s already growing around these new development this five level bridge shanghai shanghai was very intriguing city s explod level that don think any city has experience fact even shenzhen the economic zone one the first ones years ago was about people and today boasts about million that gives you idea the kinds migration and the speed with which this just the taxi being built volkswagen there s them here and they being built for most the big cities beijing and shanghai shenzhen and this isn even the domestic car market this the taxi market and what would see here suburban development similar thing but they all high rise they put time and they just the same way single family well would here area and the density quite incredible and one the things this picture that wanted point out that when saw these kinds buildings was shocked see that they not using central air condition system every window has air condition and sure there are people here who probably know better than about efficiencies but can imagine that every apartment having own air condition very efficient way cool building this scale and when you start looking that and then you start factor into city the size shanghai s literally forest skyscraper s breath taking terms the speed which this city transform and you can see the fore ground this picture s still one the last areas that was being held right now that s all clear out this was done about eight months ago and high rise are now going into that central spot skyscraper built literally over night shanghai most recently went and started looking some the biggest industries china and this steel right outside shanghai this the coal supply for the steel factory square kilometers s incredibly massive operation think workers five cupolas and the sixth one s coming here they building very large blast furnaces try deal with the demand for steel china this three the visible blast furnaces within that shot and again looking these images there s this constant like haze that you seeing this going show you real time assemble s circuit break hours day this speed think one the issues that here are facing with china that they using lot the latest production technology that one there were people that worked the floor and asked the manager point out five your fastest produce and then went and looked each one them for about minutes and picked this one woman and was just lightning fast the way she was working was almost unbelievable but that the trick that they got right now that they winning with that they using all the latest technologies and extrusi machines and bringing all the components into play but the assembly where they actually bringing the country workers are very willing work they want work there s massive back people want their jobs that condition s going there for the next years they realize what they want which you know million more people coming into the cities this particular case this the assembly line that you saw this shot had use very small aperture get the depth field had have them freeze for seconds get this shot took five fake tries because they were just going slow them down was literally impossible they were just wound doing these things all day long until the manager had with ster voice say okay everybody freeze wasn too bad but they driven produce these things incredible rate this textile mill doing synthetic silk oil product and what you seeing here again one the most state the art textile mill there are these machines they worth about dollars each you have about people running this and they just and they just walking the lines the machines are all running absolutely incredible see what the scale industries are and started getting further and further into the factories and that s diptych lot pair try and get the sense scale these places this line where they get the threads and they wind the threads together pre going into the textile mill here s something that s far more labor intensive which the making shoes this floor has about workers this floor the company itself had about employee and they doing domestic shoes was very hard get into the international companies because had get permission from companies like nike and adidas and that s very hard get and they don want let but the domestic was much easier just gives you sense again and that s where really the whole migration jobs started going over china and making the shoes nike was one the early ones was such high labor component that made lot sense after that labor market this high tech mobile phone bird mobile phone one the largest mobile makers china think mobile phone companies are ping literally week basis and they have explosive growth mobile phones this textile where they doing shirt young the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory china and this next shot here one the lunch room everything very efficient while setting this shot people average would spend eight minutes having lunch this was one the biggest factories ever seen they make coffee makers here the biggest coffee maker and the biggest iron makers they make million them the world there s employee this one factory and they had several them half kilo meter long these are just recently shot just came back about month ago you the first ones seeing these these new factory pictures taken s taken almost year gain access into these places the other aspect what s happening china that there s real need for materials there lot the recycled materials that are collect here are being recycled and taken china ship that s cube metal this armatures electrical armatures where they getting the copper and the high end steel from electrical motor out and recycling them this certainly connected california and silicon valley but this what happens most the computers fifty percent the world s computers end china recycled s refer waste there and bit problem the way they cycle the boards that they actually use the coal briquettes which are used all through china but they heat the boards and with pair pliers they pull off all the components they trying get all the value metals out those components but the toxic smell when you come into town that s actually doing this kind burning the boards you can smell good five kilometers before you get there here s another operation s all cott industries s not big places s all people s front porch their back yard even their home they burning boards there s concern for somebody coming because considered china illegal doing but they can stop the product from coming this portrait not usually known for portrait but couldn resist this one where she s been through mao and she s been through the great leap forward and the cultural revolution and now she s sitting her porch with this waste side her s quite something this road where s been shore computer boards one the biggest towns where they recycling that s the photograph that wanted show you want dedicate wishes two girls they been sitting shoulder the whole time while been thinking one s mega the one the right and katja there and the whole notion the things photograph are out great concern about the scale our progress and what call progress and much there are great things around the corner and s palpable this room all the things that are just about break that can solve many problems really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start have positive effect and isn something that isn just affect our world but starts because think can start correct our footprint and bring down but there s growing footprint that s happening asia and growing rapid rapid rate and don think can equal ultimately the strategy think here that have very concerned about their evolution because going connected our evolution well part thinking and part wishes sitting with these thought mind and thinking about how their life going when they want have children when they ready get married years from now whatever years from now and that has been the core behind most thinking work and also for this incredible chance have some wishes wish one world changing want use images persuade millions people join the global conversation sustainability and through communication today that believe that that not real idea and went search wanted put what had mind itch something didn want wish just start from where one them starting from almost nothing but the other one wanted find out what s going that s working right now and worldchanging com fantastic blog and that blog now being visited close half million people month and just started about months ago and the beauty what s going there that the the conversation the that like what they doing there that they not think the environmental movement has failed that s used the stick too much s used the apocalyptic too much hasn sold the positive aspect being environmentally concerned and trying pull out where this conversation that going this blog about positive movement about how change our world better way quickly and s looking technology and s looking new energy saving device and s looking how think and how strateg the movement towards sustainability and for one the things that thought would put some work the service promoting the worldchanging com website some you might know s tedster stephen sagmeister and are working some and this still preliminary stages these aren the final but these images with worldchanging com can placed into any kind media they could posted through the web they could used bill board bus shelter anything that nature looking this trying build out and what ended discuss was that most media you get mostly image with lot text and the text blast all over what was unusual according stephen less than five percent ads are actually leading with image and this case because s about lot these images and what they represent and the kinds questions they bring that thought letting the images play out and bring someone say well what s worldchanging com with these images have and hopefully inspire people that website worldchanging com and building that blog and blog and hoping that isn don see the kind blog where all going follow each other death this one one that will spoke out and will out and start reaching because right now there s conversation india china south america there s entries coming from all around the world think there s chance have dialogue conversation about sustainability worldchanging com and anything that you can promote that would fantastic wish two more the bottom ground one that trying work with and this one wish launch ground break competition that motivate kids invest ideas and invent ideas sustainability and one the things that came out who actually nominated said something earlier brains rming she said that recycling canada had fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six and you think about you know grade four wife and say age seven the age reason they into the age reason and they pre puberty s this great window where they actually are you can influence them you know what happens puberty you know know that from earlier presentation thinking here that try motivate those kids start driving home ideas let them understand what sustainability and that they have vested interest happen and one the ways thought doing use prize would take dollars the winning and the rest going manage this project but use that prize for kids get into their hands but the other thing that thought would fantastic was create these call them prize target and one could for the best sustainable idea for school project the best one for household project could the best community project for sustainability and also thought there should nice prize for the best work for world and what would happen s scalable thing and can get people put things whether s equipment like media lab money make the prize significant enough and open all the school that are public school school that are with kids that age and make wide open competition for them after those prize and submit them and the prize has verifiable thing s not about just ideas the art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and them but the actual things have verifiable that way what s happening that motivating certain age group start thinking and they going push that from the bottom into believe into the household and parents will acting and trying help them with the projects and think starts motivate the whole idea towards sustainability very positive way and starts teach them they know about recycling now but they don really think get sustainability all the things and the energy footprint and how that matter and teach them would fantastic wish and would something that would certainly put shoulder into and again world the competition would use the work that comes from that competition promote and like the words world because gives possession the world the person who s doing world s not someone else s want help want something with think has great opportunity engage the imagination and great ideas think come from kids and engage their imagination into project and something for school think all school could use extra equipment extra cash s going incentive for them that and these are some the ideas terms where could possibly put some promotion for world and wish three film was told should one for myself and always wanted actually get involved with doing something and the scale work and the kinds ideas playing with when first saw film almost immediately thought there s real resonance between what trying and the scale what try photographer and think there s real possibility reach new audience had chance looking really for ment because just had birthday and don have time back school right now too busy need somebody who can put quick catch course how something like that and lead through the how one does something like this that would fantastic those are three wishes
