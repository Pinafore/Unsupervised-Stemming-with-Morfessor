accepting his ted prize cameron sinclair demonstrate how passionate designers and architects can respond world housing rise unveils his ted prize wish for network improve global living standards through collaborative design ted prize activism architecture collaboration culture design disaster relief global issues invention open source philanthropy social change cameron sinclair open source architecture going take you journey very quickly explain the wish going have take you somewhere which many people haven been and that s around the world when was about years old store and myself started organization get architects and designers involved humanitarian work not only about responding natural disaster but involved system issues believed that where the resource and expertise are scarce innovative sustainable design can really make difference people s lives started life architect training architect and was always interested socially responsible design and how you can really make impact but when went architectural school seemed that was the black sheep the family many architects seemed think that when you design you design jewel and s jewel that you try and crave for where felt that when you design you either improve you create ment the community which you designing you not just doing building for the residents for the people who are going use but for the community whole and started responding the issue the housing crisis for return refugee kosovo and didn know what was doing like say mid s and the the internet generation started website put call out there and surprise couple months had hundreds entries from around the world that led number prototypes being built and really experiment with some ideas two years later started doing project developing mobile health clinic sub saharan africa responding the hiv aids pandemic that led entries from countries also have designers from around the world that participate and had exhibit work that follow that was the tipping point for started responding natural disaster and getting involved iran and bam also following our work africa working within the united states most people look poverty and they see the face foreign but live live montana the north plain the reserv ations down alabama mississippi pre katrina and could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries been got involved and worked inner cities and else where and then also will into some more projects mother nature kick our arse think can pretty much assume that was horr ific year when comes natural disaster and because the internet and because connection blogs and forth within literally hours the tsunami were already raising fund getting involved working with people the ground run from couple laptop the first couple days had emails from people need help began get involved projects there and talk about some others and then course this year been responding katrina well following our construction works this brief over view really couldn manage the number people who wanted help the number quest that was getting was all coming into laptop and cell phone decided embrace open source model business that anyone anywhere the world could start local chapter and they can get involved local problems because believe there such thing utopia all problems are local all solutions are local and that means you know somebody who based mississippi know more about mississippi than what happened used meet and all these other kind internet tools and ended having chapter starting thousands architects countries the bullet point sorry never suit knew that was going take this off because going very quick the past seven years this isn just about nonprofit what showed that there s grassroots movement going socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got lot smaller and that have the opportunity not the responsibility but the opportunity really get involved making change adding that time what you don know got these thousands designers working around the world connected basically website and have staff three doing something the fact that nobody told couldn did and there s something said about naive seven years later developed that got advocacy instigation and implement ation advocate for good design not only through student workshop and lecture and public ed have book humanitarian work but also disaster mitigat and dealing with public policy can talk about fema but that s another talk instigation developing ideas with communities and ngos doing open source design competition refer ring match making with communities and then implement actually going out there and doing the work because when you invent s never reality until s built s really important that designing and trying create change build that change here s lect number projects kosovo this kosovo did open design competition like said led whole variety ideas and this wasn about emergency shelter but transition shelter that would last five years that would placed next the land the resident lived and that they would rebuild their own home this wasn imposing architecture community this was giving them the tools and and the space allow them rebuild and grow the way they want have from the lime the ridiculous but they worked this able hemp house was built works this ship ping contain built and works and whole variety ideas that not only deal with architectural building but also the issues governance and the idea creating communities through complex network engage not just designers but also you know whole variety technology based professionals using rubble from destroyed home create new home using straw bale construction creating heat wall and then something remarkable happened went africa originally look the housing issue within three days realized the problem was not housing was the growing pandemic hiv aids and wasn doctors telling this was actual village that were stay with and came with the bright idea that instead getting people walk kilometers see doctors you get the doctors the people and started engaging the medical community and thought you know thought were real bright you know parks come with this great idea mobile health clinic widely distribute throughout sub saharan africa and the community the medical community there said said this for the last decade know this just don know how show this way had taken pre existing need and shown solutions and again had whole variety ideas that came this one personally love because the idea that architecture not just about solutions but about raising awareness this kenaf clinic you get seed and you grow plot land and then once and grow feet month and the fourth week the doctors come and they out area put tens structure the top and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and village you cut down the clinic and you eat s eat your own clinic s dealing with the fact that you have aids you also need have nutrition rates and the idea that the idea nutrition important getting anti retroviral out there you know this serious solution this one love the idea s not just clinic s community center this looked setting trade route and economic engine within the community can self sustain project every one these projects sustainable that s not because tree hugg green person s because when you live four dollars day you living survival and you have sustainable you have know where your energy coming from you have know where your resource coming from and you have keep the maintenance down this about getting economic engine and then night turns into movie theater s not aids clinic s community center you can see ideas and these ideas developed into prototypes and they were eventually built and currently this year there are clinic roll out nigeria and kenya from that also developed siyathemba which was project the community came and said the problem that the girls don have education and working area where young women between the ages and have percent hiv aids rate and that s not because they promiscuous s because there s knowledge and decided look the idea sports and create sports center that double hiv aids reach center and the coach the girls team were also trained doctors that there would very slow way developing kind confidence health care and picked nine finalist and then those nine finalist were distribute throughout the entire region and then the community picked their design they said this our design because s not only about engaging community s about empower community and about getting them part the rebuild process the winning design here and then course actually and work with the community and the clients this the designer s out there working with the first ever women s soccer team kwa zulu natal siyathemba and they can tell better video well name because work the african center consult and also the national foot ball player for south africa bafana bafana and also play the voda league for the team called tembisa which has now changed siyathemba this our home ground cameron sinclair going show that later because running out time can see chris looking s this was connection just meeting with somebody who wanted develop africa s first tele medicine center tanzania and met literally couple months ago already developed design and the team over there working partnership this was match making thanks couple tedster unclear cheryl hell and drew zolli who connected with this amazing african woman and start construction june and will opened global when you come global you can check out but what known probably most for dealing with disaster and development and been involved lot issues such the tsunami and also things like hurricane katrina this dollar shelter that can easily assemble this community designed community center and what that means actually live and work with the community and they part the design process the kids actually get involved mapping out where the community center should and then eventually the community actually through skills training end building the building with here another school this what the gave these guys for six months plastic tarps this was august this was the replacement and s supposed last for two years when the rain comes down you can hear thing and the summer s about degrees inside said the rain s coming down let s get fresh water every one our school have rain water collection systems very low cost class three class room and rain

architects and designers and inventor around the world that are getting involved humanitarian work more hemp house s japan apparently not sure what they smoking this grip clip designed somebody who said all you need some way attach membrane structure physical support this guy designed for nasa now doing housing going whip through this quickly because know got only couple minutes this all done the last two years showed you something that took years and this just selection things that were built the last couple years from brazil india mexico alabama china israel palestine vietnam the average age designer who gets involved this project that s how old s young just have stop here because the room and this the best designed toilet the world you ever ever india use this toilet chris luebke will tell you why sure that s how wanted spend the party but the future not going the sky crap cities new york but this and when you look this you see crisis what see many many inventor one billion

three people will live planned settlement refugee camp look left look right one you will there how improve the living standards five billion people with million solutions wish develop community that active embrace innovative and sustainable design improve the living conditions for everyone chris anderson wait second wait second that s your wish that s wish that s his wish started architecture for humanity with dollars and website chris somehow decided give why not this many people open source architecture the way you have diverse community participant and not just talking about inventor and designers but talking about the funding model role not designer s conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world and what need something that replicate global because haven slept seven years secondly what will this thing designers want respond issues humanitarian crisis but they don want some company the west taking their idea and basically profit from creative common has developed the developing nations license and what that means that designer can the siyathemba project showed was the first ever building have creative common license soon that built anyone africa any developing nation can take the construction document and replicate for free why not allow designers the opportunity this but still protect their rights here want have community where you can load ideas and those ideas can tested earth quake flood all sorts austere environment the reason that s important don want wait for the next katrina find out house works that s too late need now doing that global and want this whole thing work multi lingu ally when you look the face architect most people think gray hair white guy don see that see the face the world want everyone from all over the planet able part this design and development the idea needs based competition prize for the other percent you want call that also want look ways match making and putting funding partners together and the idea integ rating manufacturers fab lab every country when hear about the laptop and s going educate every child educate every designer the world put one every favela every slum settlement because you know what innovation will happen and need know that s called the leap back talk about leap frog technologies write with worldchanging and the one thing been talking about learn more the ground than ever learned here let s take those ideas adapt them and can use them these ideas are supposed have adapt able they should have the potential for evolution they should developed every nation the world and useful for every nation the world what will take there should sheet don have time read this because going yanked off just leave there for sec well what will take you guys are smart s going take lot computing power because want the idea that any laptop anywhere the world can plug into the system and able not only participate developing these design but utilize the design also process review the design want every engineer the world check and make sure that doing stuff that s standing because those guys are the best the world plug and you know want these and just should note have two laptop and one them there there and that has design drop that laptop what happens s important have these prove ideas put there easy use easy get hold mom once said there s nothing worse than being all mouth and users fed talking about making change you only make doing changed fema guide lines changed public policy changed international response based building things for s important that create real conduit for innovation and that s free innovation think free culture this free innovation somebody said this couple years back will give point for those who know think the man was maybe years too early let s thank you
